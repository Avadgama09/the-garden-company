faqs:
  - q: "Which indoor plant is best for bedrooms in India?"
    a: "Snake plant is the best bedroom plant because it releases oxygen at night and absorbs CO₂, unlike most plants that do the opposite. It also tolerates AC, low light, and irregular watering—perfect for a room you mostly use while sleeping."
  - q: "Can I grow indoor plants in water instead of soil?"
    a: "Yes. Money plant, lucky bamboo, syngonium, and philodendron grow well in just water. Change the water every 7–10 days to prevent mosquito breeding and root rot. Add a few drops of liquid fertiliser monthly for healthy growth."
  - q: "How do I stop fungus gnats in my indoor plant pots?"
    a: "Fungus gnats thrive in constantly wet soil. Let the top 2 inches of soil dry completely between waterings. Use yellow sticky traps near pots to catch adults, and sprinkle a thin layer of sand on the soil surface to block egg-laying."
  - q: "What indoor potting mix should I use in India?"
    a: "Mix 40% cocopeat, 40% garden soil, and 20% vermicompost. This gives good drainage, aeration, and nutrition. Avoid using pure garden soil—it compacts in pots and suffocates roots. Add a handful of neem cake to prevent soil pests."
  - q: "Why do my indoor plant leaves turn yellow even when I water regularly?"
    a: "Regular watering is often the problem, not the solution. Yellowing usually means overwatering—roots sitting in soggy soil cannot absorb nutrients. Check soil moisture before watering. If the top 2 inches are still damp, wait another day or two."
  - q: "Do indoor plants attract mosquitoes or insects indoors?"
    a: "Only if you overwater. Stagnant water in saucers or wet soil creates breeding grounds. Always empty saucers after watering, ensure pots drain fully, and avoid keeping water-grown plants uncovered. Healthy, well-drained indoor plants do not attract mosquitoes."

## You Don't Need a Garden to Be a Gardener

The first plant I ever kept alive was a money plant in a glass bottle on my kitchen shelf. No pot, no soil, no fancy setup. I just snipped a cutting from my neighbour's balcony, dropped it in water, and forgot about it. Two weeks later, it had roots. A month later, it was trailing down the shelf.

That one plant changed everything. It taught me that indoor gardening isn't about having the right space—it's about putting the right plant in the space you already have. This guide breaks it down room by room, so you can skip the trial-and-error phase and the five plants you'll otherwise kill along the way.

## Room-by-Room Plant Placement

Light, humidity, and airflow vary dramatically between rooms. Here's what actually works in each:

### Living Room

Your living room usually gets the most natural light and space—go big here. **Areca Palm** fills corners beautifully and acts as a natural humidifier. **Rubber Plant** offers bold, glossy leaves that tolerate low to bright light. **Money Plant (Pothos)** trails from high shelves or climbs a moss pole in almost any light condition.

### Bedroom

Bedrooms need calm, low-maintenance plants that improve air quality while you sleep. **Snake Plant** releases oxygen at night through CAM photosynthesis—one of the few plants that actually improves bedroom air after dark. **Peace Lily** tolerates low light and droops visibly when thirsty, so you'll never wonder when to water. **Aloe Vera** also releases nighttime oxygen and the gel inside helps with minor burns.

### Bathroom

Bathrooms offer consistent humidity—plants that love moisture thrive here. **Boston Fern** loves steam and low light (hang it from the ceiling). **ZZ Plant** handles steam well with its waxy leaves and needs almost no attention. **Spider Plant** manages humidity, low light, and temperature swings from hot showers.

### Kitchen

Kitchens are warm and often have a window. **Pothos** above cabinets tolerates cooking heat. **Herbs (Tulsi, Mint, Coriander)** in small windowsill pots give you fresh ingredients and greenery. **Spider Plant** removes carbon monoxide and xylene—common near gas stoves.

## The 7 Best Indoor Plants for Indian Homes

These plants are proven survivors in apartments across climate zones, from humid Mumbai to dry Jaipur:

| Plant | Light Needed | Watering | Special Strength |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Snake Plant | Low to bright | Every 2–4 weeks | Nighttime oxygen, near-indestructible |
| Money Plant | Any light | Weekly | Grows in water or soil, trails beautifully |
| ZZ Plant | Low to medium | Every 2–3 weeks | Drought-tolerant, glossy foliage |
| Peace Lily | Low to medium | When soil dries | Flowers in shade, clear watering signal |
| Spider Plant | Indirect light | Every 5–7 days | Easy propagation, pet-safe |
| Areca Palm | Bright indirect | Weekly | Natural humidifier, tropical look |
| Aglaonema | Low to medium | Weekly | Colourful foliage, very forgiving |

If you're starting out, pick any two from this list. They're all beginner-proof.

## Soil, Pots & Feeding Basics

Never use pure garden soil for indoor plants. It compacts in containers, blocks drainage, and suffocates roots—the number one cause of indoor plant death.

**The ideal indoor potting mix for India:**
1. 40% cocopeat (moisture retention + aeration, ₹50–100 per block)
2. 40% garden soil (structure + minerals)
3. 20% vermicompost (slow-release organic nutrition)
4. Optional: handful of perlite for drainage, pinch of neem cake powder for pest prevention

**Pot rules:** Always use pots with drainage holes. Terracotta breathes well but dries faster in summer. Plastic nursery pots inside decorative cachepots give you drainage plus aesthetics. Choose a pot 1–2 inches wider than the root ball—oversized pots hold excess water and cause root rot.

**Feeding:** Diluted liquid seaweed fertiliser monthly from March–October. Skip November–February when most houseplants go semi-dormant. Feeding during dormancy causes salt buildup that burns roots.

## Common Problems in Indian Homes

### Overwatering During Monsoon

Humidity hits 80–90% in coastal cities during June–September. Indoor soil stays wet much longer than usual. **Reduce watering frequency by half during monsoon.** If the top 2 inches feel damp, skip watering entirely.

### Hard Water

Mumbai and most Indian cities supply hard water with high chlorine. Over time, this causes white salt deposits on soil and browning leaf edges. **Fix:** Let tap water sit overnight before watering. Chlorine evaporates within 12–24 hours. Flush pots monthly with excess water to wash out salts.

### Mealybugs

White cottony clusters on stems and leaf joints? That's mealybugs—the most common indoor pest in India. **Treatment:** Wipe each bug off with a cotton bud dipped in rubbing alcohol. Follow up with weekly neem oil spray (5 ml neem oil + 1 litre water + drop of liquid soap). Always quarantine new plants for 1–2 weeks before adding them to your collection.

### Dust on Leaves

Indian city dust accumulates rapidly and blocks photosynthesis. Wipe large-leaved plants (rubber plant, peace lily, monstera) with a damp cloth every 2 weeks. For ferns, a gentle shower under the tap works.

## Mumbai / Indian Home Gardener Notes

- **AC rooms** dry air rapidly. Mist humidity-loving plants (ferns, calathea) 2–3 times weekly, or place pots on a pebble tray filled with water.
- **North-facing apartments** get minimal direct light. Stick to ZZ plant, snake plant, and pothos. Avoid flowering plants in spaces with less than 2 hours ambient light.
- **Vastu placement:** Money plant in southeast or north, tulsi in east or northeast, snake plant in south or southeast.
- **Monsoon tip:** Move plants away from open windows during heavy rain. Splashing rainwater carries dust and pollutants.
- **Summer tip:** Water before 8 AM. Evening watering keeps soil wet overnight, inviting fungal growth.

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**Watering on a fixed schedule.** "Every Sunday" fails because soil dries at different rates depending on season and humidity. Always finger-test moisture first.

**Decorative pots without drainage.** Water pools at the bottom, roots rot silently. Use cachepots (inner nursery pot + outer decorative pot) instead.

**Ignoring leaf dust.** A dust layer forms within days in Indian cities. This blocks photosynthesis and weakens the plant slowly. Wipe fortnightly.

**Repotting too often.** Repot only when roots circle the pot bottom or poke through drainage holes—usually every 18–24 months.

**Fertilising in winter.** Adding nutrients during dormancy causes salt buildup. Resume feeding in March when growth restarts.
