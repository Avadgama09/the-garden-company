faqs:
  - q: "How do I tell the difference between a fungal and bacterial disease on my plant?"
    a: "Fungal diseases usually show visible growth on the surface — powdery coatings, fuzzy mold, or rusty pustules. Bacterial diseases produce water-soaked lesions, angular spots that follow leaf veins, and sometimes a foul smell. If you see surface growth, it is almost always fungal."
  - q: "Can I save a plant that has a viral disease like mosaic or leaf curl?"
    a: "Unfortunately, no. There is no cure for viral plant diseases. Remove and destroy the infected plant immediately to prevent it from spreading to healthy plants through insects like aphids and whiteflies."
  - q: "Why do my plants get more diseases during Mumbai's monsoon season?"
    a: "Mumbai's monsoon brings sustained high humidity, warm temperatures, and prolonged leaf wetness — ideal conditions for fungal diseases like powdery mildew, leaf spot, and root rot. Move plants under partial shelter and avoid wetting foliage."
  - q: "What is the first thing I should do when I notice disease symptoms?"
    a: "Isolate the plant immediately. Move it away from other plants, then inspect it closely — check leaf undersides, stems, and soil. Identify the disease type before treating. Rushing to spray without diagnosis often makes things worse."
  - q: "Is neem oil effective against all plant diseases?"
    a: "Neem oil works well against many fungal diseases like powdery mildew, leaf spot, and rust. It also deters pest vectors. However, it cannot cure bacterial or viral infections. For bacterial problems, copper-based sprays are more appropriate."
  - q: "How often should I inspect my plants for signs of disease?"
    a: "Check your plants every 2–3 days, especially during monsoon and post-monsoon months. Focus on leaf undersides, new growth, soil surface, and stem bases. Early detection is the single biggest factor in successful treatment."

Your plant is trying to tell you something. Yellow patches, white powder, dark spots, curling leaves — every symptom is a clue. The hard part is reading those clues correctly before the problem spirals.

I learned this the expensive way. A single leaf spot on my balcony tomato in July turned into a full-blown blight by August because I assumed it was "just monsoon stress" and ignored it. By the time I acted, three plants were gone. That experience taught me one thing: with plant diseases, **the diagnosis matters more than the treatment**.

This guide will teach you how to identify the three main types of plant diseases — fungal, bacterial, and viral — using simple visual clues that any home gardener can spot. No lab equipment needed, just your eyes, your phone camera, and a bit of patience.

## Why Disease Identification Matters

Treating a disease incorrectly is worse than not treating it at all. Spraying neem oil on a bacterial infection wastes time. Overwatering a plant with root rot kills it faster. And no amount of fertilizer fixes a viral disease.

The goal of disease identification is straightforward: **figure out what type of pathogen you are dealing with before you pick up a spray bottle**. Plant diseases fall into three broad categories based on the pathogen — fungi, bacteria, or viruses. Each behaves differently, looks different, and requires a different response.

Once you know the category, you can narrow down the specific disease and choose the right treatment. Think of it as a funnel: broad type first, then specific disease, then targeted action.

## How to Diagnose: The 5-Step Process

Before jumping into disease types, here is a simple diagnostic process you can follow every time you see something wrong with your plant.

1. **Isolate the plant** — Move it away from your other plants immediately. Fungal spores travel through air and water splash, so distance matters.
2. **Observe where symptoms appear** — Are older (lower) leaves affected, or newer growth? Is it one side of the plant or everywhere? Patterns narrow down the cause.
3. **Look closely at the symptom** — Use your phone camera to zoom in. Is there visible growth on the surface (powder, fuzz, pustules)? Are spots angular or circular? Is there a halo around the spot?
4. **Check the undersides of leaves** — Many diseases and the pests that spread them hide underneath. Flip every suspicious leaf.
5. **Consider the context** — Has it been raining heavily? Did you recently overwater? Is there poor airflow? Did you bring in a new plant? Environmental context eliminates wrong guesses fast.

This process takes five minutes and saves weeks of wasted treatment.

## Fungal Diseases: The Most Common Culprit

Fungi cause the vast majority of plant diseases in Indian home gardens. They love moisture and warmth — which means Mumbai's climate is essentially a fungal playground, especially from June through October.

The good news: fungal diseases are usually the easiest to identify because **you can often see the fungus itself** on the plant surface.

### Powdery Mildew

A white, talcum-powder-like coating on leaf surfaces, stems, and sometimes buds. It starts as small white patches and spreads outward. Common on roses, peas, tomatoes, cucumbers, and chili. Thrives in cool mornings with warm afternoons and poor airflow — classic Mumbai winter weather from December to February.

**Treatment:** Remove affected leaves. Spray with neem oil solution (2 tsp cold-pressed neem oil + 1 tsp mild liquid soap + 1 litre water). Improve air circulation around the plant. Repeat weekly until clear.

### Leaf Spot Diseases (Cercospora, Alternaria, Septoria)

Circular or irregular brown-to-black spots on leaves, often with a yellow halo. Some leaf spots show concentric rings that look like a target or bull's-eye. Older (lower) leaves are usually affected first. Common on tomatoes, peppers, beans, and roses.

**Treatment:** Remove and dispose of infected leaves. Avoid overhead watering. Apply a copper-based fungicide or neem oil spray. Clean up fallen leaves around the base of the plant.

### Root Rot (Pythium, Phytophthora, Fusarium)

The plant wilts despite the soil being wet. Leaves turn yellow across the whole plant — not just old leaves. When you unpot the plant, roots are brown, black, or slimy instead of white and firm. There may be a foul, mushy smell. Extremely common in overwatered containers and during monsoon when drainage fails.

**Treatment:** Often difficult to reverse. Remove the plant from the pot, trim away all rotted roots with sterilised scissors, and repot in fresh, well-draining soil. Water sparingly. Adding Trichoderma (a beneficial fungus, available as a powder at Indian nurseries for ₹50–100) to the new soil helps prevent recurrence.

### Rust Diseases

Orange, yellow, or reddish-brown raised pustules on the undersides of leaves — they literally look like rust on metal. Common on peas, mustard, jasmine, wheat microgreens, and some ornamentals. Winter in India (December–February) is peak rust season, especially when temperatures hover between 15–25°C.

**Treatment:** Remove all infected leaves. Spray with a sulfur-based fungicide or neem oil. Ensure adequate spacing between plants so air circulates freely.

### Downy Mildew

Yellow patches on the upper leaf surface with a purple-gray fuzzy growth underneath. Unlike powdery mildew, downy mildew lives on the underside. Common on cucumbers, lettuce, spinach, and cabbage family crops. Worst during sustained humidity above 70%.

**Treatment:** Remove affected leaves. Improve ventilation. Water in the morning so foliage dries during the day. Apply copper-based spray if needed.

### Blight (Early and Late)

Brown or black patches that spread rapidly across leaves and stems. Early blight shows bull's-eye patterns on lower leaves first. Late blight appears anywhere and can kill a plant in days — this is the disease that caused the Irish Potato Famine. Common on tomatoes and potatoes, especially during or just after monsoon.

**Treatment:** Remove infected parts immediately — do not wait. Apply copper fungicide. In severe cases, remove the entire plant to save others. Stake plants off the ground and avoid wetting foliage.

## Bacterial Diseases: Harder to Spot, Harder to Treat

Bacterial diseases are less common than fungal diseases in home gardens, but they are more serious because **there is no effective organic cure**. Treatment focuses on removal and prevention.

### How to Tell It Is Bacterial

Bacterial infections produce water-soaked, greasy-looking lesions that later turn brown or black. Leaf spots tend to be **angular** — they follow the leaf veins rather than forming neat circles. In severe cases, you may notice a slimy ooze on cut stems or a foul smell from the affected area.

### Common Bacterial Diseases

- **Bacterial Leaf Spot:** Angular brown or black spots with bright yellow halos. Common on tomatoes, peppers, and beans. Spreads through water splash and contaminated tools.
- **Bacterial Wilt:** Sudden wilting of the entire plant despite adequate watering. If you cut the stem near the base and place it in water, you may see a milky stream of bacteria oozing out. Common on tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant. No cure — remove and destroy the plant immediately.
- **Bacterial Blight:** Water-soaked patches that expand rapidly, turning dark brown. Can defoliate a plant quickly. Common on beans and some ornamentals.

### What to Do

Remove and destroy all infected plant material — do not compost it. Sterilise your pruning tools with rubbing alcohol or a 10% bleach solution after every cut. Avoid handling plants when they are wet, as bacteria spread easily through water. Copper-based sprays can slow bacterial spread but rarely eliminate it. Focus on prevention: clean tools, clean hands, dry foliage, and resistant varieties.

## Viral Diseases: No Cure, Only Prevention

Viral diseases are the least common but most frustrating because **there is absolutely no treatment**. Once a plant is infected, it stays infected.

### How to Tell It Is Viral

Viruses produce distinctive patterns that look different from fungal or bacterial damage:

- **Mosaic patterns** — Irregular patches of light green, yellow, and dark green across the leaf surface, creating a mottled appearance.
- **Leaf curl** — Leaves curl upward or downward and may thicken or become brittle.
- **Stunted, distorted growth** — New leaves come out crinkled, small, or misshapen.
- **No visible surface growth** — Unlike fungi, you will never see powder, fuzz, or pustules. The leaf surface looks clean but wrong.

### Common Viral Diseases in India

- **Mosaic Virus:** Affects tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, beans. Spread by aphids and contaminated tools.
- **Tomato Leaf Curl Virus (ToLCV):** One of the most destructive viruses in Indian vegetable gardens. Spread by whiteflies. Leaves curl upward, growth stunts, and fruit production drops to near zero.

### What to Do

Remove and destroy infected plants immediately — every day you wait, insect vectors carry the virus to your healthy plants. Control aphids and whiteflies aggressively (neem spray, sticky traps, soap spray) because they are the primary carriers. When buying seedlings, choose virus-resistant varieties when available. Sterilise tools between plants.

## Quick Identification Table

| Feature | Fungal | Bacterial | Viral |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Surface growth visible?** | Yes — powder, fuzz, pustules, mold | No (sometimes slimy ooze) | No |
| **Spot shape** | Circular, with rings or halos | Angular, follows leaf veins | Mottled, irregular mosaic |
| **Spread speed** | Moderate (days to weeks) | Fast (hours to days) | Slow (but incurable) |
| **Smell** | Musty (root rot) | Foul, sour | None |
| **Treatable?** | Yes — neem oil, copper, sulfur | Limited — removal is primary | No — remove and destroy |
| **Worst season (Mumbai)** | Monsoon (Jun–Sep), Winter (Dec–Feb) | Monsoon | Year-round (vector-dependent) |

## Mumbai and Indian Home Gardener Notes

Mumbai's climate creates a unique disease pressure calendar. Knowing when to expect trouble helps you prevent it rather than react to it.

**Monsoon (June–September)** is peak fungal season. Sustained humidity above 80%, daily rain, and warm temperatures make root rot, leaf spot, and blight nearly inevitable if drainage is poor. Move containers under partial shelter. Water only when needed — the rain is probably doing it for you. Spray preventive neem oil every 2 weeks starting in late May.

**Post-monsoon (October–November)** brings a second wave. Cool humid air is perfect for powdery mildew and rust. Pest populations (aphids, whiteflies) also explode during this period, increasing virus transmission risk. Scout your plants every 2 days.

**Winter (December–February)** favours powdery mildew and rust. Cool nights and warm-ish afternoons create ideal conditions. Ensure maximum sun exposure and good airflow.

**Summer (March–May)** is the lowest disease risk period in Mumbai, though spider mites thrive in hot, dry conditions. Root rot can still occur in overwatered containers.

**A note on Mumbai's water:** Tap water TDS of 200–400 ppm and slightly alkaline pH can gradually shift soil pH, making nutrients less available. Weakened, nutrient-starved plants are more susceptible to disease. Flush your containers with clean water once a month to prevent salt buildup.

## Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)

**Treating before diagnosing.** You see spots on a leaf and immediately reach for neem oil. But what if it is a bacterial infection? Neem oil will not help. What if it is sunburn? You have wasted time and stressed the plant with unnecessary spraying. Always identify first, treat second.

**Spraying in direct sunlight.** Neem oil, soap spray, and copper fungicide applied in hot sun will burn your leaves. The brown patches from spray burn look exactly like disease — creating a confusing cycle. Always spray early morning (before 8 AM) or evening (after 5 PM).

**Ignoring the undersides of leaves.** Most fungal spores germinate on leaf undersides where moisture lingers. Many pest vectors (whiteflies, aphids) also live there. If you only spray the tops of leaves, you are missing where the real action happens.

**Keeping infected plants "just in case."** Especially with viral diseases, gardeners hold onto infected plants hoping they will recover. They will not — and every day the plant sits in your garden, insects carry the virus to healthy neighbours. Be ruthless. Remove and destroy.

**Using garden soil in containers.** Unsterilised garden soil is loaded with fungal spores, bacteria, and nematodes. For containers, always use a clean potting mix — cocopeat, vermicompost, and perlite is a safe combination available at most Indian nurseries.

**Not cleaning tools between plants.** Your pruning shears can carry bacterial and viral pathogens from a sick plant to a healthy one in one snip. Wipe blades with rubbing alcohol or dip in diluted bleach between plants. It takes 10 seconds and prevents cross-contamination.

## Action Checklist
