## Why Summer Watering is Different

Summer in India means intense heat, rapid soil drying, and higher plant stress. The rules that work in winter will kill your plants in May.

## Water Deep, Not Often

One deep watering every 2 days is better than light watering every day. Deep watering pushes moisture down to the roots where it matters.

## Best Time to Water

Always water early morning — before 8am. This gives roots time to absorb moisture before heat peaks. Evening watering invites fungal disease.

## Signs Your Plant Needs Water

- Soil is dry 2 inches below the surface
- Leaves look slightly dull or droopy in the morning
- Pot feels noticeably lighter than usual
