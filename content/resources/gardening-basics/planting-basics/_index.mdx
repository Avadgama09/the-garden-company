faqs:
  - q: "How deep should I plant seeds?"
    a: "A simple rule: plant seeds 2-3 times as deep as the seed's diameter. Tiny seeds like coriander need barely any covering—just press them into the surface. Larger seeds like beans go about 1 inch deep."
  - q: "Should I water seeds immediately after planting?"
    a: "Yes, but gently. Water with a spray or light sprinkle—not a strong stream that washes seeds away. Keep soil consistently moist (not soaking wet) until germination happens."
  - q: "What's the difference between planting seeds and transplanting seedlings?"
    a: "Seeds go directly into soil and germinate there. Transplanting means moving a young plant (already sprouted) from one container to its final growing spot. Seedlings need gentler handling and immediate watering after transplanting."
  - q: "How much space should I leave between plants?"
    a: "It depends on the mature plant size. Leafy greens like spinach can be 6 inches apart. Tomatoes need 18-24 inches. Overcrowding leads to competition for light, water, and nutrients—always check spacing on seed packets."
  - q: "Can I plant seeds in regular garden soil?"
    a: "For containers, no—garden soil gets too dense. Use a light potting mix (cocopeat + compost + soil). For ground planting, loosen garden soil first and add compost to improve drainage and fertility."
  - q: "Why do my seedlings keep dying after I transplant them?"
    a: "Transplant shock. Avoid it by: transplanting in the evening (not midday heat), watering thoroughly before and after, handling seedlings by leaves (not stems), and providing shade for 2-3 days while they adjust."

# Planting Basics: How to Plant Seeds and Seedlings the Right Way

The first time I planted tomato seeds, I buried them an inch deep because I figured "deeper = safer." They never came up. Weeks later, I tried again with lettuce seeds—this time barely covering them with soil—and they sprouted within four days.

That's when I learned that planting isn't just "put seed in soil and hope." There are simple rules that make the difference between seeds that germinate and seeds that rot, between seedlings that thrive and seedlings that wilt.

The good news: you don't need a horticulture degree. You need to understand three basic things—**depth, spacing, and watering**. Get those right, and most plants will grow just fine. Get them wrong, and even the best seeds in the best soil won't help you.

This guide covers the fundamentals of planting seeds and transplanting seedlings for Indian home gardens—from when to plant what, to how deep, how far apart, and how to avoid the mistakes that kill most beginners' plants in the first two weeks.

## Seeds vs. seedlings: which should you start with?

Beginners often ask: should I grow from seeds or buy small plants from the nursery?

**The honest answer: both have their place.**

### Start with seeds when:

- You want the full experience (and satisfaction) of growing something from scratch
- You're planting leafy greens or herbs (coriander, spinach, methi, radish, lettuce)—these germinate fast and transplant poorly, so direct seeding works best
- You want variety not available as seedlings in local nurseries
- You're planting in bulk (seeds are cheaper per plant)
- It's the right season for direct sowing (October-November in North India, post-monsoon in most regions)

### Start with seedlings when:

- You want faster results (seedlings give you a 3-4 week head start)
- You're planting tomatoes, chillies, eggplant, or peppers (these take 6-8 weeks from seed to transplant-ready size)
- You have limited space and want to skip the germination phase
- You're new and want to reduce variables (buying healthy seedlings removes germination uncertainty)

**Practical approach for beginners:** Start 70% with seedlings (tomatoes, chillies, flowering plants from nursery) + 30% with seeds (coriander, methi, radish, beans) that are fast and easy. You'll see success quickly, which keeps you motivated to try more seeds later.

## The golden rule of seed planting depth

This is the single most important planting rule:

**Plant seeds 2-3 times as deep as the seed's diameter (width).**

That's it. Memorize that one line and you'll get 90% of seeds right.

### What this looks like in practice:

**Tiny seeds (coriander, lettuce, basil, carrot):**
- Seed diameter: 1-2mm
- Planting depth: barely cover with soil (2-4mm)
- Method: Sprinkle seeds on surface, press gently with fingers, dust a thin layer of soil or cocopeat on top

**Small-medium seeds (spinach, methi, radish, mustard):**
- Seed diameter: 2-3mm
- Planting depth: 5-8mm (about 1/4 inch)
- Method: Make shallow furrow with finger, drop seeds, cover lightly

**Medium-large seeds (beans, peas, okra, cucumber):**
- Seed diameter: 5-10mm
- Planting depth: 1-2cm (about 1/2 to 1 inch)
- Method: Poke holes with finger to depth, drop seed, cover firmly

**Large seeds (bitter gourd, ridge gourd, corn):**
- Seed diameter: 10-15mm
- Planting depth: 2-3cm (about 1 inch)
- Method: Dig small hole, place seed flat, cover and pat down

### Why depth matters:

**Too shallow:** Seeds dry out before germinating, or wash away with first watering. Wind or birds can displace them.

**Too deep:** Seed runs out of energy (stored food) before the sprout reaches sunlight. It germinates but dies underground before you ever see it.

**Right depth:** Seed stays moist, protected, and has just enough soil covering to anchor it while conserving energy to push through to light.

### The exceptions (seeds that need light to germinate):

A few seeds actually germinate BETTER with light exposure. For these, press into soil surface but don't cover:
- Lettuce (very tiny seeds)
- Some flower seeds (petunias, snapdragons—check packet)

When in doubt, check the seed packet. Most packets specify exact depth. If there's no packet (kitchen seeds like coriander, methi, chilli), use the 2-3× rule.

## How to plant seeds step-by-step (containers and ground)

### Planting seeds in containers (pots, grow bags)

**Step 1: Prepare the container**
- Use pots with drainage holes (non-negotiable)
- Fill with light potting mix: 40% cocopeat + 30% compost + 30% garden soil (or use readymade potting mix)
- Moisten the mix before planting—dry soil pulls moisture from seeds

**Step 2: Make planting holes or furrows**
- For individual large seeds (beans, cucumber): poke holes with finger to correct depth, spaced evenly
- For small seeds in rows (coriander, spinach): use a pencil or stick to draw a shallow line/furrow across the pot

**Step 3: Place seeds**
- Drop seeds into holes or sprinkle along furrow
- Spacing within the row: leave 1-2 inches between small seeds, 3-4 inches between large seeds
- For beginners: plant 2-3 seeds per spot (insurance against poor germination), thin later to strongest seedling

**Step 4: Cover seeds**
- Gently cover with soil or cocopeat to correct depth
- Pat down lightly (good seed-to-soil contact helps germination)
- Don't pack it hard—seedlings need to push through

**Step 5: Water gently**
- Use a spray bottle, watering can with fine rose (sprinkler head), or even your fingers to sprinkle water
- Goal: moisten the top layer without washing seeds away or creating puddles
- Soil should be damp throughout, not soaking wet

**Step 6: Maintain moisture until germination**
- Check soil daily—keep surface consistently moist but not waterlogged
- In hot weather, you may need to mist twice a day
- Most seeds germinate in 5-10 days (coriander 7-10 days, radish 3-5 days, tomatoes 7-14 days)

**Step 7: Thin seedlings (if needed)**
- Once seedlings have 2-3 true leaves, thin to one strong seedling per spot
- Don't pull out extras (disturbs roots)—snip at soil level with scissors

### Planting seeds directly in the ground

**Step 1: Prepare the soil**
- Loosen soil to 6-8 inches depth with a garden fork or spade
- Remove weeds, rocks, and clumps
- Mix in 2-3 inches of compost or vermicompost to improve fertility and drainage
- Rake smooth

**Step 2: Mark rows or planting spots**
- Use a stick or hoe to draw straight furrows for row planting
- Or mark individual spots for plants that need more space (like tomatoes planted from seed)
- Row spacing depends on plant type (see spacing section below)

**Step 3: Plant seeds at correct depth**
- Follow the 2-3× diameter rule
- For rows: sprinkle small seeds along furrow; for large seeds, place every few inches
- For hills (cucumber, gourds): plant 3-4 seeds in a small cluster, thin later to 1-2 plants

**Step 4: Cover and firm**
- Cover seeds with soil to correct depth
- Gently press down with hands or back of hoe (establishes contact)
- For large areas, you can gently tamp with feet

**Step 5: Water thoroughly**
- Use a hose with gentle spray nozzle or watering can
- Water until soil is moist 2-3 inches deep (not just surface)
- Avoid strong water jets that create gullies or displace seeds

**Step 6: Mulch (optional but helpful)**
- Thin layer of dried leaves, grass clippings, or cocopeat over planted area
- Keeps soil moist, reduces watering frequency, prevents soil crust that blocks tiny seedlings

**Step 7: Monitor and maintain**
- Keep soil consistently moist until germination
- Thin seedlings when they're 2-3 inches tall
- Watch for pests (birds, insects) and protect if needed (netting or mesh cover)

## Spacing: why it matters and how to get it right

Overcrowding is one of the top beginner mistakes. Plants too close together compete for light, water, nutrients, and air circulation—leading to weak plants, disease, and poor yields.

### Why spacing matters:

- **Light access:** Crowded plants shade each other → leggy stems, poor growth
- **Air circulation:** Touching leaves trap moisture → fungal diseases thrive
- **Root competition:** Roots fight for water and nutrients → stunted plants
- **Pest spread:** Pests jump easily from plant to plant when they're touching

### General spacing guidelines for common Indian home garden plants:

**Leafy greens:**
- Spinach, methi, lettuce: 15cm (6 inches) apart, rows 20cm apart
- Coriander (harvest as microgreens): broadcast densely, thin to 2-3cm apart
- Amaranth: 20cm (8 inches) apart

**Herbs:**
- Basil, mint, parsley: 20-25cm (8-10 inches) apart
- Curry leaf (shrub): 60cm (2 feet) from other plants

**Vegetables (fruiting):**
- Tomatoes: 45-60cm (18-24 inches) apart, rows 60-90cm apart
- Chillies: 30-45cm (12-18 inches) apart
- Okra: 30cm (12 inches) apart, rows 45cm apart
- Eggplant: 45cm (18 inches) apart

**Root vegetables:**
- Radish: 5-8cm (2-3 inches) apart, rows 15cm apart
- Carrot: 5cm (2 inches) apart, rows 20cm apart
- Beetroot: 10cm (4 inches) apart

**Vining plants (with trellis):**
- Beans (pole): 15cm (6 inches) apart along trellis
- Gourds (bitter gourd, bottle gourd): 60-90cm (2-3 feet) apart

**Container spacing (multiple plants per pot):**
- Small pots (6-8 inch): 1 plant (tomato, chilli) or 3-4 plants (coriander, methi)
- Medium pots (10-12 inch): 1 large plant or 5-6 small greens
- Large containers/grow bags: follow ground spacing above

**Pro tip:** When in doubt, go wider. It's easier to fill empty space with mulch or additional quick-growing greens than to fix overcrowded plants.

## Transplanting seedlings without shock

Whether you bought seedlings from a nursery or started seeds in small containers, eventually you'll need to move them to their final growing spot.

**Transplant shock** is when plants wilt, yellow, or even die after being moved. It's caused by root disturbance, sudden environment change, or poor technique. Here's how to minimize it:

### Best time to transplant:

- **Time of day:** Late afternoon or evening (not midday heat)
- **Weather:** Cloudy day ideal; avoid transplanting in bright sun or heat wave
- **Plant age:** When seedlings have 3-4 true leaves and visible roots but aren't root-bound
- **Season:** During the cooler part of planting season (early morning or evening)

### Step-by-step transplanting process:

**Step 1: Water seedlings thoroughly 1-2 hours before transplanting**
- Moist root ball holds together better
- Hydrated plants tolerate stress better
- Makes roots easier to remove from container

**Step 2: Prepare the new planting spot**
- Dig holes twice as wide as the root ball (depth same as current soil level)
- Mix handful of compost into bottom of hole
- Pre-moisten the hole (pour water in, let it absorb)

**Step 3: Remove seedling carefully**
- Gently squeeze sides of container to loosen
- Turn upside down with hand supporting soil surface
- Seedling should slide out with intact root ball
- If roots are tangled (root-bound), gently loosen outer roots with fingers

**Step 4: Place in new hole**
- Position so top of root ball is level with surrounding soil (not deeper, not higher)
- Burying too deep can cause stem rot
- Planting too shallow exposes roots

**Step 5: Backfill and firm**
- Fill around root ball with soil, pressing gently to eliminate air pockets
- Don't pack too hard (roots need oxygen)
- Create a slight depression around base to hold water

**Step 6: Water immediately**
- Water thoroughly until soil is saturated
- This settles soil around roots and provides immediate hydration
- Use gentle stream, not forceful jet

**Step 7: Provide temporary shade (if needed)**
- In hot weather or bright sun, shade transplants for 2-3 days
- Use shade cloth, cardboard, or even a larger pot placed nearby
- Allows roots to establish before dealing with full sun stress

**Step 8: Monitor closely for first week**
- Check soil moisture daily (newly transplanted plants can't reach far for water yet)
- Watch for wilting (normal for first day, concerning if it continues)
- Reduce watering slightly after roots establish (usually 7-10 days)

### Handling seedlings: what to touch, what not to touch:

- **Hold by:** The leaves or the root ball
- **Never hold by:** The stem (it bruises easily and kills the plant)
- **Roots:** Handle as little as possible, keep moist, don't let them dry out even for a few minutes

## Watering after planting: the first two weeks

The period right after planting (seeds or seedlings) is critical. Too much water = seeds rot or seedlings develop root rot. Too little water = seeds don't germinate or seedlings wilt and die.

### For newly planted seeds:

**Goal:** Keep soil surface consistently moist (like a wrung-out sponge) until germination.

**Frequency:** Check daily. In hot weather, may need light misting 2× per day. In cool weather, once a day or every other day.

**Method:** Gentle spray or mist to avoid washing seeds away.

**Signs of correct moisture:**
- Surface feels damp when touched
- Soil color is darker (moist) not light brown/grey (dry)
- No puddles or standing water

**After germination:**
- Once seedlings emerge, reduce watering frequency slightly
- Let top 1cm dry between waterings (encourages roots to grow downward searching for moisture)
- Continue gentle watering until seedlings are 2-3 inches tall

### For newly transplanted seedlings:

**Day 1-3:** Water daily (sometimes twice if very hot)
- Roots are damaged and can't absorb efficiently yet
- Plant is in shock, using stored energy
- Keep soil consistently moist to reduce stress

**Week 1:** Water every 1-2 days depending on weather
- Check soil 2 inches down—if dry, water; if moist, skip
- Roots are starting to explore new soil
- Watch plant, not calendar—wilting means needs water

**Week 2:** Transition to regular watering schedule
- By now roots have established in new location
- Water when top 2-3 inches of soil dry
- Plant should look perky, growing new leaves

**Weather adjustments:**
- Hot/dry/windy: increases evaporation, water more often
- Cool/humid/overcast: slows evaporation, water less often
- Monsoon/rain: skip watering if rain provides >1 inch

**Container vs. ground:**
- Containers dry faster (water more often)
- Ground soil retains moisture longer (water less often)

## Common planting mistakes beginners make

### Mistake 1: Planting seeds too deep

Tiny seeds (coriander, lettuce, carrot) buried 1 inch deep never see sunlight. They germinate underground, run out of energy, and die before reaching the surface.

**Fix:** Follow the 2-3× diameter rule. When in doubt, go shallower for small seeds.

### Mistake 2: Planting in dry soil

Dropping seeds into dry soil then watering afterward often washes seeds away or leaves air pockets around them.

**Fix:** Pre-moisten potting mix or soil before planting. Water gently after planting to settle, not to initially moisten.

### Mistake 3: Overwatering after planting

Keeping soil soaking wet 24/7 drowns seeds (they need oxygen too) and invites fungal diseases.

**Fix:** Moist, not wet. If you squeeze soil and water drips out, it's too wet. If it clumps but doesn't drip, it's right.

### Mistake 4: Planting in compacted soil

Hard, dense soil prevents tiny seedling roots from penetrating. They germinate but can't establish.

**Fix:** Loosen soil thoroughly before planting. Add cocopeat or compost to improve texture. For containers, never use straight garden soil—always use a light potting mix.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring spacing requirements

Planting 10 tomato plants in a small pot because "more plants = more tomatoes." Result: 10 weak, diseased plants and zero tomatoes.

**Fix:** Follow spacing guidelines. More space = healthier plants = better yields. Less is more.

### Mistake 6: Transplanting in midday heat

Moving seedlings during the hottest part of the day (12-3 PM) maximizes transplant shock.

**Fix:** Always transplant in evening or on cloudy days. Plants have overnight to recover before facing sun again.

### Mistake 7: Not hardening off seedlings grown indoors

Seedlings started indoors (or bought from nursery greenhouse) are pampered. Sudden outdoor exposure shocks them.

**Fix:** Harden off for 5-7 days—gradually expose to outdoor conditions for increasing hours each day before final transplant.

### Mistake 8: Planting the wrong season

Planting cool-season crops (peas, lettuce, coriander) in peak summer = they bolt or die immediately.

**Fix:** Match planting time to plant needs. Cool-season = October-February in most of India. Warm-season = March-June. Check our Regional Gardening guide for your specific climate.

### Mistake 9: Burying seedlings too deep at transplant

Tomato seedlings buried up to their first leaves may develop stem rot. (Tomatoes are the exception—they can be buried deeper and will form roots on the buried stem.)

**Fix:** For most plants, keep the soil level the same as it was in the original container. Top of root ball = level with new soil surface.

### Mistake 10: Not thinning seedlings

Planting 5 seeds "just in case" then letting all 5 grow. Result: overcrowded, competing, weak plants.

**Fix:** Thin to the strongest 1-2 seedlings per spot once they have 2-3 true leaves. Snip extras at soil level (don't pull—disturbs roots of keeper plant).

## Mumbai / Indian home gardener notes

**High-rise balconies:** Wind dries out newly planted seeds and transplants fast. Water more frequently than ground-level gardens, and use slightly deeper planting for seeds (within reason) to prevent them blowing away before they establish.

**Monsoon planting:** June-September is tricky. Heavy rains can wash away seeds or waterlog transplants. Use containers with excellent drainage, plant seeds slightly deeper to anchor them, and move containers under cover during torrential rain.

**Hot season (April-June):** Germination slows in extreme heat (soil temperature too high). Plant seeds slightly deeper to reach cooler, moister soil. Shade newly planted areas during peak afternoon sun.

**North India winter:** Cold soil (below 10°C) prevents germination of warm-season seeds. Start seeds indoors or wait until soil warms (March). Transplants need frost protection—cover with cloth on cold nights.

**Cocopeat availability:** India has excellent cocopeat (coconut coir) supply since we're a coconut-producing country. It's better than peat moss (imported, expensive, not sustainable) and retains moisture well for Indian heat.

**Local seed sources:** Kitchen seeds work great for starting—coriander seeds from kitchen, dried red chillies for seeds, methi seeds from spice box. For vegetable seeds, brands like Kraft Seeds, VNR Seeds, and Namdhari are reliable and widely available.

**Terrace planting:** Direct ground planting on terraces is possible if you build raised beds (12-18 inches deep) with proper waterproofing underneath. Otherwise, stick with large containers/grow bags.

## Action checklist

### Do this today

☐ Choose 2-3 plants you want to grow: 1 from seeds (easy option: coriander, radish, methi) + 1-2 from nursery seedlings (tomato, chilli, or flowering plant)  
☐ Check if you have containers with drainage holes—if not, add to shopping list  
☐ Verify you have potting mix or ingredients (cocopeat + compost + soil) ready  

### Do this week

☐ Buy seeds and/or seedlings based on current season (check our regional guide for timing)  
☐ Prepare planting containers or ground bed: fill with potting mix, loosen soil, mix in compost  
☐ Plant your first seeds at correct depth (2-3× seed diameter rule)  
☐ Set a daily reminder to check soil moisture for the next 10 days  
☐ Label what you planted and when (easy to forget, trust me)  

### Do this month

☐ Monitor germination: seeds should sprout within 5-14 days depending on type  
☐ Thin seedlings to proper spacing once they have 2-3 true leaves  
☐ Transplant any seedlings to final spots using evening transplanting technique  
☐ Maintain consistent watering schedule—daily checks for first two weeks, then adjust based on soil moisture  
☐ Watch for signs of problems: if seedlings are leggy (need more light), yellowing (might be overwatered), wilting (need water or transplant shock), adjust accordingly  
☐ Start a simple garden journal: note what you planted, when, what worked, what didn't—invaluable for next season
