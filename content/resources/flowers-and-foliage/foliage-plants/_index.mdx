faqs:
  - q: "What's the advantage of foliage plants over flowering plants?"
    a: "Foliage plants provide year-round color without seasonal limitations. Flowers bloom then fade—coleus stays vibrant 365 days. They're lower maintenance (no deadheading, less feeding), handle shade better, and thrive during monsoon when flowering plants struggle. Plus, propagation is incredibly easy—one plant becomes ten within months."
  
  - q: "Can foliage plants survive in shade better than flowering plants?"
    a: "Yes, dramatically better. Most flowering plants need 6+ hours sun. Foliage plants like caladium, ferns, and some coleus varieties thrive in 2-4 hours of indirect light or bright shade. Many actually prefer shade—direct sun can scorch leaves or fade colors. Perfect for north-facing balconies or indoor spaces."
  
  - q: "Why do my coleus colors fade after a few weeks?"
    a: "Three main causes: (1) Insufficient light—colors intensify with bright indirect light, (2) Flowering—flower spikes drain energy and reduce leaf color; pinch them off immediately, (3) Old age—coleus naturally becomes leggy; take cuttings and start fresh plants every 4-6 months for best color."
  
  - q: "How do I propagate coleus and other foliage plants?"
    a: "Ridiculously easy. Cut 10-12 cm stem tip with at least 2 leaf nodes. Remove lower leaves. Place in water (change every 2-3 days) or directly into moist soil. Roots appear in 7-14 days. Plant when roots are 2-3 cm long. Success rate near 100%. One plant → endless supply."
  
  - q: "Can I grow foliage plants indoors in Mumbai?"
    a: "Absolutely. Low-light champions: pothos, snake plant, ZZ plant, Chinese evergreen (aglaonema). Medium-light options (near windows): coleus, croton, dumb cane. High-humidity lovers: ferns, caladium (mist regularly or use pebble tray). Avoid: plants requiring full sun won't thrive indoors."
  
  - q: "Why are my croton leaves dropping?"
    a: "Crotons hate change. Sudden temperature drops, drafts from AC, moving to different location, or watering schedule changes trigger leaf drop. Also check: (1) Underwatering (crispy edges first), (2) Cold exposure (below 15°C), (3) Overwatering (yellowing first), (4) Low humidity. Crotons need consistency and warmth."

The first time I grew coleus, I thought I'd done something wrong.

I bought one plant—a vibrant red-and-green variety—and stuck it in a shaded corner of my balcony. Within two weeks, the stem had developed roots at every leaf node just from high humidity. A month later, that single plant had turned into six after I took cuttings that rooted in water glasses on my kitchen windowsill.

I hadn't *tried* to propagate it. Coleus just wanted to multiply.

That's when I understood the magic of foliage plants: they're not just beautiful, they're generous. Most propagate easily from cuttings, many tolerate conditions that would kill flowering plants, and the best part? That color doesn't fade when flowers finish. It's there every single day, monsoon through summer, year after year.

This guide covers everything you need to grow stunning foliage plants—from choosing varieties for your light conditions to propagation techniques that turn one plant into dozens.

## Why Grow Foliage Plants

**365 days of color:** Flowers bloom for weeks then rest. Coleus, croton, and caladium stay colorful year-round. Your garden looks good January through December, not just during bloom seasons.

**Shade gardening solutions:** That north-facing balcony that gets 2-3 hours indirect light? Flowering plants struggle there. Foliage plants thrive. Caladium, ferns, and many coleus varieties actually prefer shade.

**Monsoon champions:** June-September when heavy rain and humidity damage delicate flowers, foliage plants are in their element. Most actually grow better during monsoon. Your garden stays beautiful when neighbors' petunias are rotting.

**Lower maintenance:** No deadheading, no worrying about bloom timing, less fertilizer needed. Most foliage plants are remarkably self-sufficient once established.

**Texture and form:** Flowers provide color, but foliage plants add architectural interest. Large elephant ear leaves, delicate fern fronds, bold croton patterns—these create visual depth flowers can't match.

**Easy propagation:** Most foliage plants root easily from cuttings. Buy one coleus, have twenty plants within six months. Share with neighbors, fill your balcony, experiment with arrangements—all from one initial investment.

**The tradeoff:**

Some foliage plants (croton, caladium) are fussier about consistency than hardy flowers like marigolds. They dislike sudden changes—temperature, watering schedule, location. Once you understand their needs, they're easy. But initial learning curve can be steeper.

## Top Foliage Plants for Indian Home Gardens

### Coleus

**Why it's the champion:** Leaves in combinations of red, purple, pink, orange, yellow, green, and burgundy. Hundreds of varieties—solid colors, splashed, bordered, veined, or spotted. Grows fast, propagates easily, tolerates a wide range of conditions.

**Growth habit:** Bushy, 30-60 cm tall depending on variety and pruning. Naturally wants to become leggy—regular pinching keeps it compact.

**Light requirements:** Varies by variety. Most thrive in bright indirect light or partial sun (3-5 hours). Full sun varieties exist but need gradual acclimatization. Shade varieties tolerate 2-3 hours indirect light.

**General rule:** More sun intensifies colors but too much direct sun can scorch. Find the sweet spot for your specific variety.

**Soil needs:** Well-draining potting mix. Not picky about soil quality—grows in almost anything with decent drainage.

**Watering:** Prefers consistently moist soil but tolerates brief dry periods. Leaves wilt dramatically when thirsty (but usually recover within hours of watering). Water when top 3-5 cm feels dry.

**Feeding:** Light feeders. Balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks sufficient. Too much nitrogen makes leaves less colorful.

**The pinching rule (CRITICAL):** Pinch off growing tips every 2-3 weeks. This prevents legginess and encourages bushier growth with more colorful leaves. Also, pinch off any flower spikes immediately—they drain energy from leaves and signal the plant to become woody.

**Propagation:** Absurdly easy. Cut 10-12 cm stem with 2-3 leaf nodes. Remove lower leaves. Place in water (roots in 7-10 days) or directly into moist soil. Success rate near 100%.

**Seasonal behavior:** In Mumbai, coleus grows year-round. In North India, it may slow or die back in cold winter (below 10°C). Take cuttings in October and grow indoors through winter.

**Why I always have coleus:** When petunias finish blooming in April and my balcony looks bare, coleus provides continuous color through the brutal 38°C heat and monsoon. Plus, that propagation. I've given away fifty+ coleus plants to neighbors, all from three original plants.

**Cost:** ₹30-80 per plant (but you'll never need to buy more after mastering propagation)

### Croton

**Why it's stunning:** Bold, tropical foliage in yellow, orange, red, purple, and green. Leaf shapes vary from broad ovals to narrow ribbons, some twisted. Every leaf is a piece of art. Mature plants can have 50+ leaves, each different.

**Growth habit:** Upright shrub, 60-180 cm tall depending on variety and pot size. Slow to moderate growth. Can live for years, becoming more spectacular over time.

**Light requirements:** Bright indirect light to partial direct sun. 4-6 hours of morning sun ideal. Colors fade in deep shade, leaves scorch in harsh afternoon sun. Near a bright window works perfectly indoors.

**Soil needs:** Well-draining, slightly acidic to neutral. Mix 40% cocopeat, 40% garden soil, 20% vermicompost.

**Watering:** Prefers consistent moisture. Don't let soil dry completely between waterings. Leaves droop when thirsty. Hates both drought and waterlogging—find the middle ground.

**Temperature sensitivity (IMPORTANT):** Crotons are tropical babies. Below 15°C triggers leaf drop. Keep away from air conditioning vents, cold drafts, and unheated spaces in winter. Mumbai's climate is perfect—North India gardeners may need to bring crotons indoors November-February.

**Feeding:** Every 6-8 weeks with balanced fertilizer. Not heavy feeders.

**The consistency rule:** Crotons hate change. Pick a spot, stick with it. Don't move them around. Maintain consistent watering. Sudden changes (temperature, location, watering schedule) cause leaf drop. They recover, but it's stressful.

**Propagation:** More challenging than coleus. Air layering is most reliable method. Stem cuttings possible but slower (2-3 months for roots). Dip cut ends in rooting hormone for better success.

**Challenges:** That leaf drop thing. Also, mealybugs and spider mites love crotons. Wipe leaves weekly with damp cloth—keeps pests away and leaves shiny. Isolate new crotons for 2 weeks before introducing to other plants.

**Why grow it despite fussiness:** Because those colors. A mature croton is a conversation piece. Mine is five years old, 4 feet tall, with leaves ranging from chartreuse to deep burgundy. It's the star of my balcony.

**Cost:** ₹150-500 per plant depending on size and variety

### Caladium

**Why it's unique:** Heart-shaped leaves in stunning pink, white, red, and green combinations. Veining patterns look hand-painted. Grown from tubers, not seeds or cuttings. Deciduous—goes dormant in winter (this is normal).

**Growth habit:** Low-growing, 30-45 cm tall. Foliage clumps from underground tubers. Each tuber produces multiple leaves.

**Light requirements:** Shade to partial shade. Bright indirect light perfect. Direct sun bleaches colors or burns leaves. Ideal for those impossible shady corners where nothing else grows.

**Soil needs:** Rich, well-drained, high organic content. Mix 50% cocopeat, 30% vermicompost, 20% garden soil.

**Watering:** Keep soil consistently moist during growing season (April-October). Never let dry out completely. Reduce drastically when leaves start yellowing naturally in October-November.

**Growing season:** Plant tubers in April-May when monsoon arrives (warmth + humidity trigger growth). Foliage lasts April-October. Leaves yellow and die back November-February—this is natural dormancy, not death.

**Winter dormancy care:** Option 1: Leave tubers in pot, store entire pot in cool, dry place, stop watering. Option 2: Lift tubers after foliage dies, dry, dust with fungicide, store in barely damp sawdust or vermiculite. Resume watering in late March-April when temperatures warm.

**Feeding:** Every 4-6 weeks during growing season with balanced liquid fertilizer.

**Propagation:** Divide tubers when lifting for storage. Each division should have at least one growing eye. Let cut surfaces dry 24 hours before storing or replanting.

**Why grow a plant that disappears half the year?** Because those leaves during growing season are spectacular. No flower can match the color combinations. Perfect for adding drama to shaded spaces in Mumbai's humid months.

**Cost:** ₹40-100 per tuber (larger tubers produce more leaves)

### Pothos (Money Plant)

**Why it's everywhere:** Nearly indestructible. Tolerates low light, irregular watering, and neglect. Trailing vines look beautiful in hanging baskets or climbing supports. Variegated varieties (yellow-and-green) add color.

**Growth habit:** Trailing or climbing vine. Can reach several meters if supported. Small, heart-shaped leaves.

**Light requirements:** Low to bright indirect light. Grows in almost any light condition. Colors are more vibrant in brighter light.

**Soil needs:** Not picky. Any well-draining potting mix works.

**Watering:** Water when top 5 cm feels dry. Tolerates both slight drought and slight overwatering. Leaves yellow if overwatered consistently.

**Feeding:** Minimal. Balanced fertilizer every 6-8 weeks sufficient.

**Propagation:** Ridiculously easy. Cut stem with 2-3 leaf nodes. Place in water. Roots in 7-14 days. Each node can produce roots—one vine can become dozens of plants.

**Why everyone should have pothos:** It's the gateway plant. Success with pothos builds confidence. Plus, it actually thrives on neglect. My neighbor's pothos has survived two months of her traveling without watering (sitting in a bathroom with ambient light). Still alive.

**Cost:** ₹30-100 per plant (but propagate and never buy again)

### Snake Plant (Sansevieria)

**Why it's called indestructible:** Tolerates extreme neglect, low light, irregular watering, and still looks architectural and beautiful. Upright, sword-like leaves with yellow edges or patterns.

**Growth habit:** Upright, clumping rosettes. Height varies by variety (30 cm to 120 cm). Slow-growing.

**Light requirements:** Low light to full sun. Adapts to almost any light condition. Grows faster in brighter light.

**Soil needs:** Well-draining essential. Succulent/cactus mix ideal. Avoid water-retaining soil—causes root rot.

**Watering:** Minimal. Water when soil is completely dry (every 2-3 weeks, sometimes monthly). Overwatering is the only way to kill snake plant. Leaves become mushy when overwatered.

**Feeding:** Very light feeders. Balanced fertilizer every 3-4 months sufficient.

**Propagation:** Leaf cuttings (slow—3-6 months) or division of clumps (faster, easier).

**Why I recommend it:** For people who travel, forget to water, or have extremely low-light spaces. Snake plant doesn't care. It survives. And that architectural form adds modern elegance.

**Cost:** ₹100-400 per plant depending on size

### Ferns (Boston Fern, Maidenhair Fern, Bird's Nest Fern)

**Why they're special:** Delicate, lush fronds create texture no other plant offers. Classic tropical look. Excellent air purifiers.

**Growth habit:** Varies by species. Boston fern forms arching, cascading fronds (hanging baskets). Maidenhair has delicate, lacy foliage. Bird's nest grows upright rosette of smooth fronds.

**Light requirements:** Shade to bright indirect light. No direct sun—scorches fronds. Perfect for bathrooms, shaded balconies, under trees.

**Soil needs:** Rich, well-draining, high organic content. Ferns love moisture but hate waterlogging.

**Watering (CRITICAL):** Keep soil consistently moist, never soggy, never dry. Ferns hate drying out—fronds brown and crisp. Check soil daily. Mist fronds in dry weather.

**Humidity requirements:** Ferns need high humidity. Mumbai's monsoon climate is perfect. In dry weather or air-conditioned rooms, use pebble trays (pot sits on pebbles in water-filled tray, not touching water directly) or mist daily.

**Feeding:** Light feeders. Diluted liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during growing season.

**Challenges:** That moisture + humidity requirement. Ferns aren't for "I forget to water" gardeners. Also, brown tips appear if air is too dry—unsightly but not fatal.

**Why grow them:** That lush, tropical aesthetic. Ferns make small spaces feel like jungle retreats. My bathroom fern (naturally high humidity from showers) has thrived for three years with minimal care.

**Cost:** ₹100-300 per plant

### Aglaonema (Chinese Evergreen)

**Why it's perfect for beginners:** Gorgeous variegated leaves (green with pink, red, white, or silver markings). Tolerates low light better than most colorful foliage plants. Compact size suits small spaces.

**Growth habit:** Low, clumping growth. 30-60 cm tall. Slow-growing.

**Light requirements:** Low to medium indirect light. Brighter varieties (red, pink) need more light than green/white ones. No direct sun.

**Soil needs:** Well-draining potting mix.

**Watering:** Allow top 5 cm to dry between waterings. Overwatering causes stem rot (much worse than underwatering).

**Feeding:** Light feeders. Balanced fertilizer every 6-8 weeks.

**Propagation:** Division of clumps or stem cuttings.

**Why I recommend it:** Colorful foliage that tolerates low light is rare. Aglaonema delivers. Perfect for indoor spaces away from windows or shaded balconies.

**Cost:** ₹150-500 per plant

## Choosing Foliage Plants by Light Conditions

### Bright Indirect Light to Partial Sun (4-6 hours indirect or 2-4 hours direct)

**Best options:** Coleus (most varieties), croton, caladium, pothos, arrowhead plant (syngonium)

**What this looks like:** Near east-facing window, north-facing balcony with reflected light, under tree canopy

### Shade to Low Light (2-4 hours indirect light)

**Best options:** Pothos, snake plant, ZZ plant, Chinese evergreen, ferns, peace lily

**What this looks like:** Interior rooms away from windows, bathrooms with small windows, heavily shaded balconies

### Indoor (Air-conditioned spaces)

**Best options:** Snake plant, ZZ plant, pothos, Chinese evergreen

**Challenges:** Low humidity from AC. Mist plants or use pebble trays. Avoid cold-sensitive plants like croton near AC vents.

### Full Sun (6+ hours direct)

**Foliage plants for full sun:** Limited options. Sun coleus (specific varieties), duranta (golden dewdrop—chartreuse foliage), some ornamental grasses.

**Reality check:** Most foliage plants evolved in forest understories. They prefer shade or filtered light. If you have full sun, flowering plants or succulents are better choices.

## Propagation Techniques for Foliage Plants

### Water Propagation (Easiest for Beginners)

**Best for:** Coleus, pothos, philodendron, syngonium, some begonias

**Steps:**
1. Cut 10-15 cm stem with at least 2 leaf nodes
2. Remove lower leaves (only 2-3 leaves remain at tip)
3. Place in clear glass/jar with clean water (cut end submerged)
4. Put in bright indirect light (not direct sun)
5. Change water every 2-3 days
6. Roots appear in 7-14 days
7. Plant in soil when roots are 3-5 cm long

**Pro tips:**
- Use room-temperature water (not cold)
- Clear container lets you monitor root development
- Multiple cuttings in one jar save space
- Success rate near 100% for coleus and pothos

### Direct Soil Propagation

**Best for:** Croton (with rooting hormone), snake plant leaf cuttings, aglaonema

**Steps:**
1. Cut stem/leaf following guidelines for each plant
2. Let cutting dry 1-2 hours (prevents rot)
3. Optional but recommended: Dip cut end in rooting hormone powder
4. Insert cutting into moist potting mix (1/3 to 1/2 depth)
5. Water lightly, keep soil barely moist (not wet)
6. Cover with clear plastic bag to maintain humidity (poke holes for air)
7. Place in bright indirect light
8. Roots develop in 2-6 weeks depending on species

### Division

**Best for:** Snake plant, ZZ plant, Chinese evergreen, ferns, caladium tubers

**Steps:**
1. Remove plant from pot
2. Gently separate root ball into sections (each with stems/leaves)
3. Use clean knife to cut through tough roots if needed
4. Replant divisions immediately in fresh potting mix
5. Water well

**When to divide:** Spring (March-April) best timing. Only divide healthy, mature plants.

### Air Layering (Advanced)

**Best for:** Croton, rubber plant, other woody-stemmed foliage plants

**Steps:**
1. Select healthy stem (pencil-thick or larger)
2. Make upward 3-5 cm cut through 1/3 of stem, or remove 2 cm ring of bark
3. Dust wound with rooting hormone
4. Pack moist sphagnum moss around wound
5. Wrap with plastic, seal top and bottom with tape
6. Check moisture weekly, add water if needed
7. Roots visible through plastic in 6-10 weeks
8. Cut stem below rooted section, pot up new plant

**Why use air layering:** Higher success rate for difficult-to-root plants. Parent plant stays intact until new plant is ready.

## Keeping Foliage Colors Vibrant

**Problem:** Coleus fades from bright red-orange to dull green. Croton loses its bold patterns. What happened?

### Light Optimization

**Rule:** More light (indirect/filtered) = more intense colors

**For coleus:** Bright indirect light or 3-4 hours morning sun brings out vibrant colors. Deep shade causes reversion to green.

**For croton:** 4-6 hours bright indirect light or morning sun. Insufficient light fades colors.

**For shade lovers (ferns, caladium):** Even these need *bright* shade. Complete darkness won't work.

### Remove Flower Spikes Immediately

**Coleus flowers:** Pinch off any flower spikes the moment they appear. Flowering signals the plant to become woody and reduce leaf color. Removing flowers keeps plant juvenile and colorful.

**Other foliage plants:** Most (aglaonema, pothos) produce insignificant flowers. Remove them—they drain energy from leaves.

### Pinching and Pruning

**Regular pinching:** Forces branching, creates bushier plant with more colorful young leaves. Young leaves are always more vibrant than old leaves.

**How to pinch:** Use fingers or scissors to remove growing tip (top 2-3 cm). Do this every 2-3 weeks for coleus and similar plants.

### Feeding Strategy

**Balanced fertilizer (10-10-10):** Maintains overall health without encouraging excessive green growth

**Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers:** Too much nitrogen produces lots of green leaves but reduces other colors

**Feed regularly but not heavily:** Every 4-6 weeks at half-strength better than monthly at full strength

### Refresh Regularly

**Coleus secret:** Mature coleus (6-12 months old) become woody and less colorful. Take cuttings and start fresh plants every 4-6 months. Always have young, vibrant coleus growing.

**Pothos refresh:** Vines become leggy with large spaces between leaves. Cut back to encourage new, bushier growth from base.

## Growing Foliage Plants Indoors

**Why indoors:** Mumbai apartments often have limited outdoor space. Many foliage plants thrive indoors with proper care.

### Indoor-Friendly Champions

**Ultra low-light winners:**
- Snake plant (corner of room, 10+ feet from window)
- ZZ plant (anywhere with ambient light)
- Pothos (adapts to almost any indoor light)

**Bright indirect light (near windows):**
- Chinese evergreen (east/west-facing window)
- Coleus (bright window, no direct sun)
- Croton (south/west-facing window in morning)
- Ferns (bright bathroom with window)

### Indoor Care Adjustments

**Light:** Rotate plants weekly so all sides receive equal light

**Humidity:** Mumbai's natural humidity helps. In AC rooms, use pebble trays or mist weekly.

**Watering:** Indoor plants dry slower. Check soil before watering—don't water on schedule.

**Dust:** Wipe leaves monthly with damp cloth. Dust blocks light and reduces photosynthesis.

**Drainage:** Even more critical indoors (no rain to flush salts). Ensure pots have drainage holes, don't let them sit in water.

**Air circulation:** Stagnant air promotes fungal issues. Open windows periodically or use gentle fan.

### Common Indoor Problems

**Leggy growth:** Insufficient light. Move closer to window or add grow light.

**Brown leaf tips:** Low humidity, fluoride in water, or salt buildup. Mist plants, use filtered water, flush soil monthly.

**Yellowing leaves:** Usually overwatering. Indoor plants need less water than outdoor ones.

## Mumbai and Indian Home Gardener Notes

### Monsoon Management (June-September)

**Advantages:**
- High humidity perfect for ferns, caladiums, coleus
- Natural rainfall reduces watering needs
- Many foliage plants grow fastest during monsoon

**Precautions:**
- Move pots under overhangs during heavy downpours
- Ensure excellent drainage—check drainage holes aren't clogged
- Increase air circulation to prevent fungal issues

### Summer Heat (March-May)

**Challenges:**
- 35-42°C temperatures, especially in North India
- Rapid soil drying
- Leaf scorch in direct afternoon sun

**Solutions:**
- Move shade-loving plants to shadiest spots
- Water morning and evening if needed
- Mulch soil surface to retain moisture
- Mist leaves in early morning (not midday—causes burn)

### Winter Care (November-February)

**Mumbai (minimal issues):**
- Temperatures rarely drop below 15°C
- Most foliage plants continue growing
- Reduce watering frequency slightly

**North India (requires attention):**
- Bring cold-sensitive plants indoors (croton, caladium)
- Protect from frost—even brief exposure kills tropical plants
- Stop fertilizing November-February
- Water sparingly—cold + wet = root rot

### Local Plant Sources

**Where to buy in Mumbai:**
- Crawford Market (huge selection, ₹30-500 per plant)
- Dadar nurseries (quality plants, good advice)
- Andheri plant shops
- Online: Ugaoo, Nurserylive, All That Grows

**What to look for:**
- Healthy, vibrant foliage (not faded or yellowing)
- No visible pests
- Firm stems (not mushy or overly woody)
- Multiple growing points (bushier plants)

### Typical Costs (Mumbai, 2026)

- Small coleus: ₹30-50
- Medium pothos: ₹50-150
- Large croton (2-3 feet): ₹300-500
- Caladium tubers: ₹40-100
- Snake plant: ₹100-400 (depending on size)
- Chinese evergreen: ₹150-500
- Ferns: ₹100-300

**Budget tip:** Buy one plant of each type you want, master propagation, never buy again.

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Leaves Losing Color/Fading

**Causes:**
1. Insufficient light (most common)
2. Flowering (coleus)
3. Natural aging
4. Over-fertilizing with nitrogen

**Solutions:** Move to brighter location. Remove flower spikes immediately. Take cuttings to refresh plant. Switch to balanced or low-nitrogen fertilizer.

### Leggy, Stretched Growth

**Causes:**
1. Insufficient light (plant stretching toward light source)
2. Not pinching regularly
3. Natural growth pattern

**Solutions:** Move to brighter spot. Pinch growing tips every 2-3 weeks. Prune back leggy stems to encourage bushier growth.

### Leaves Turning Yellow

**Causes:**
1. Overwatering (most common)—check if soil is constantly soggy
2. Underwatering—soil cracking, leaves crispy at edges
3. Natural lower leaf shedding—normal as plant grows
4. Nutrient deficiency—rare if feeding regularly

**Solutions:** Adjust watering. Check drainage. If watering is correct, feed with balanced fertilizer.

### Brown Leaf Tips or Edges

**Causes:**
1. Low humidity
2. Fluoride/chlorine in tap water
3. Salt buildup from fertilizer
4. Inconsistent watering

**Solutions:** Increase humidity (mist, pebble trays). Use filtered or rainwater. Flush soil monthly with plain water. Water consistently.

### Pests

**Spider mites (tiny, webbing on leaf undersides):**
- Increase humidity (mites hate moisture)
- Spray undersides with strong water stream
- Neem oil spray weekly

**Mealybugs (white cottony masses):**
- Remove with cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol
- Spray neem oil on entire plant
- Isolate from other plants

**Scale (brown bumps on stems):**
- Scrape off with fingernail or soft brush
- Spray neem oil
- Check regularly—scale spreads fast

### Leaves Dropping (Especially Croton)

**Causes:**
1. Sudden temperature change
2. Moving plant to new location
3. Cold drafts or AC vents
4. Severe underwatering
5. Overwatering

**Solutions:** Maintain consistency. Keep away from AC vents. Pick location and stick with it. Water regularly but don't overwater.
