faqs:
  - q: "What's the difference between perennial and annual flowers?"
    a: "Perennials live for multiple years, regrowing from the same roots each season. They have defined bloom periods (spring, summer, or fall). Annuals complete their entire life cycle in one season, blooming continuously from planting until frost, then die. Trade-off: annuals give nonstop color for one season; perennials give recurring blooms for years with less replanting work."
  
  - q: "Do perennials really bloom all year in India?"
    a: "Some do, some don't. True year-round bloomers in Mumbai/tropical zones: hibiscus, ixora, periwinkle, crossandra. These flower continuously in warm climates. Others (roses, chrysanthemums) have peak seasons with rest periods. North India perennials often go dormant in winter (below 10°C), resuming in spring."
  
  - q: "Are perennials lower maintenance than annuals?"
    a: "Generally yes, once established. Perennials need annual pruning, occasional division (every 3-4 years), and less frequent feeding. Annuals require constant deadheading, weekly feeding, and replanting every season. However, perennials demand patience—year 1 focuses on root establishment, with best blooms appearing year 2-3."
  
  - q: "Why didn't my perennial bloom this year?"
    a: "Common causes: (1) First-year plants—perennials often skip blooming year 1 to build roots, (2) Divided/transplanted recently—blooming resumes next season, (3) Insufficient sun (most need 6+ hours), (4) Over-fertilized with nitrogen (promotes leaves over flowers), (5) Needs division—overcrowded clumps reduce blooming."
  
  - q: "Can I grow perennials in pots or only in ground?"
    a: "Many perennials thrive in pots: hibiscus, ixora, roses, jasmine, periwinkle, and begonias. Use pots minimum 12-15 inches deep with drainage holes. Potted perennials need more frequent watering and feeding than in-ground plants. Repot every 2-3 years when rootbound. Divide clumping perennials every 3-4 years even in pots."

The first time I planted marigolds, I was hooked on the instant gratification. Within weeks, I had bright orange and yellow blooms covering my balcony. Then monsoon arrived, and by August, the marigolds were done—rotted stems, no flowers, just a muddy mess.

My neighbor's hibiscus, meanwhile, kept blooming straight through monsoon. September came, October, November—still flowering. I asked her how often she replanted. She laughed. "I planted this hibiscus five years ago. Never replanted it once."

That's when I understood the appeal of perennials. The trade-off between annuals and perennials isn't about "better" or "worse." It's about what you want: annuals give you maximum color for one season, then you start over. Perennials ask for patience in year one, then reward you with recurring blooms for years—sometimes decades—with far less work.

This guide covers everything you need to grow perennial flowers successfully in India: which ones bloom year-round versus seasonally, how to care for them, and how to use them strategically alongside annuals for a garden that's never bare.

## Perennials vs. Annuals: Understanding the Difference

**Perennials:**
- Live for 3+ years (some for decades)
- Roots survive dormancy; plant regrows from same root system each season
- Defined bloom periods: spring, summer, or fall (some tropical perennials bloom year-round)
- Focus energy on root establishment first, blooms second
- Lower maintenance once established

**Annuals:**
- Complete entire lifecycle in one season (germination → flowering → seed → death)
- Bloom continuously from planting until frost
- Must be replanted every season
- All energy goes to flowers (nonstop blooms)
- Higher maintenance: frequent deadheading, feeding, watering

**The practical difference for Indian gardeners:**

In Mumbai's climate (no harsh winter), some perennials blur the lines—hibiscus and ixora bloom almost year-round like annuals, but they're perennials. In Delhi's climate (winter drops to 5-10°C), most perennials go dormant November-February, resuming growth in March.

**Neither is "better"—they serve different purposes:**

- **Choose perennials when:** You want long-term investment, recurring blooms without replanting, foundation plants that anchor your garden design
- **Choose annuals when:** You want continuous, season-long color, flexibility to change color schemes annually, or fast results

**My approach:** Use perennials as the backbone (hibiscus, jasmine, ixora planted once, staying for years). Fill gaps with annuals (petunias, marigolds) for seasonal color variation. Best of both worlds.

## Year-Round Bloomers: Tropical Perennials That Never Stop

These perennials flower continuously in warm climates (Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad). In North India, they bloom March-November, often going dormant in winter.

### Hibiscus (Gudhal)

**Why it's the champion perennial:** Large, showy blooms (10-15 cm across) in red, pink, yellow, orange, white, or bicolors. Each flower lasts only one day, but plant produces new blooms daily for months. Some varieties bloom literally every day of the year in tropical zones.

**Growth habit:** Shrub, 1-3 meters tall depending on variety and pruning. Fast-growing.

**Sunlight:** Full sun (6-8 hours minimum). More sun = more flowers.

**Soil:** Well-draining, slightly acidic to neutral. Hibiscus tolerates average garden soil but thrives in rich, compost-amended soil.

**Watering:** High water needs. Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Leaves wilt dramatically when thirsty—water immediately.

**Feeding:** Heavy feeders. Balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) every 3-4 weeks during active growth. Potassium-rich fertilizer promotes flowering.

**Pruning:** Prune lightly after major bloom flush to maintain shape. Hard pruning (cutting back to 60-90 cm) in late winter (February) stimulates vigorous spring growth and heavier flowering.

**Blooming season:** Year-round in Mumbai. March-November in North India.

**Why I recommend it:** If you can grow only ONE perennial flower, choose hibiscus. It delivers daily blooms, tolerates Mumbai heat and monsoon humidity, and lives for 15-20 years with minimal care. My hibiscus is 8 years old and produces 10-15 flowers daily during peak season.

**Varieties to try:** Single-flower varieties (more blooms, easier care) or double-flower varieties (spectacular but fewer blooms).

**Cost:** ₹80-200 per plant

### Ixora (Rugmini, Rangan)

**Why it's brilliant:** Clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in red, orange, yellow, pink, or white. Each cluster lasts 2-3 weeks, with new clusters forming continuously. Incredibly reliable bloomer.

**Growth habit:** Compact shrub, 60-120 cm tall. Dense foliage makes excellent hedge or border plant.

**Sunlight:** Full sun to partial shade. Tolerates more shade than hibiscus (4-6 hours sun sufficient).

**Soil:** Slightly acidic soil (pH 5.5-6.5) preferred. Mix generous amounts of cocopeat and leaf compost to lower pH if needed.

**Watering:** Moderate. Water when top 5 cm feels dry. Tolerates brief drought better than hibiscus.

**Feeding:** Every 6-8 weeks with balanced fertilizer. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers (cause leaf growth at expense of flowers).

**Pruning:** Minimal. Remove spent flower clusters. Shape annually in late winter (February).

**Blooming season:** Year-round in tropical zones. Slows in winter in North India.

**Special care:** Yellowing leaves indicate iron deficiency (common in alkaline soil). Apply iron chelate or acidify soil with sulfur.

**Why I love it:** Zero-drama plant. Ixora blooms reliably without constant fussing. Perfect for beginners who want guaranteed flowers.

**Cost:** ₹60-150 per plant

### Periwinkle (Vinca, Sadabahar)

**Why it's everywhere:** Tough, heat-tolerant, drought-resistant, and blooms nonstop. Small, five-petaled flowers in pink, white, purple, or red with contrasting centers. "Sadabahar" literally means "always green" in Hindi—accurate description.

**Growth habit:** Low-growing, spreading ground cover or compact mound, 30-45 cm tall.

**Sunlight:** Full sun to partial shade. Adapts to almost any light condition.

**Soil:** Not picky. Tolerates poor soil. Well-draining mix prevents root rot.

**Watering:** Drought-tolerant once established. Water weekly in extreme heat, less frequently otherwise.

**Feeding:** Light feeders. Balanced fertilizer every 8-10 weeks sufficient.

**Pruning:** Pinch growing tips regularly to encourage bushiness. Shear back by 1/3 in late winter to rejuvenate.

**Blooming season:** Year-round in most of India.

**Self-seeding:** Periwinkle drops seeds that germinate easily. You'll find seedlings popping up around parent plant. Free plants!

**Beginner-friendliness:** This is THE ultimate beginner perennial. Survives neglect, blooms regardless of conditions, spreads readily. If you can't grow periwinkle, gardening might not be your thing.

**Cost:** ₹20-50 per plant

### Crossandra (Firecracker Flower, Aboli)

**Why it's special:** Bright orange, red, or yellow tubular flowers arranged in spikes. Glossy, dark green foliage provides excellent backdrop. Flowers continuously in warm weather.

**Growth habit:** Compact shrub, 30-60 cm tall. Suitable for pots or borders.

**Sunlight:** Partial shade to full sun. In Mumbai, partial shade (4-5 hours sun) produces best results—prevents leaf scorch.

**Soil:** Rich, well-draining, high organic content. Mix 50% cocopeat, 30% vermicompost, 20% garden soil.

**Watering:** Keep soil consistently moist during growing season. Reduce slightly in winter.

**Feeding:** Every 4-6 weeks with balanced liquid fertilizer during active growth.

**Blooming season:** Year-round in coastal areas. April-November in North India.

**Special care:** Sensitive to cold. Bring pots indoors or protect with covers if temperature drops below 10°C.

**Why grow it:** That orange color is stunning. Few flowers produce such vibrant, pure orange. Perfect for adding warm tones to shade gardens.

**Cost:** ₹50-120 per plant

### Jasmine (Mogra, Chameli)

**Why it's irreplaceable:** That fragrance. Nothing compares to jasmine's sweet, intoxicating scent, especially in evening. White, star-shaped flowers used for garlands, worship, and perfumes.

**Growth habit:** Climbing vine or sprawling shrub depending on variety and training, 2-6 meters.

**Sunlight:** Full sun to partial shade. 6+ hours sun for best flowering.

**Soil:** Well-draining, slightly acidic to neutral. Fertile soil promotes more flowers.

**Watering:** Keep soil evenly moist. Water frequently during summer, moderately in winter.

**Feeding:** Every 4-6 weeks during growing season. Phosphorus-rich fertilizer promotes flowering.

**Pruning:** After major bloom flush, prune to control size and shape. Remove dead or weak growth.

**Blooming season:** Peak blooms March-October. Year-round sporadic blooming in Mumbai.

**Support:** Provide trellis, fence, or arbor for climbing varieties.

**Varieties:** Mogra (Arabian jasmine, Jasminum sambac) most popular in India. Night-blooming jasmine (Raat ki Rani, Cestrum nocturnum) for intense evening fragrance.

**Why it's essential:** Jasmine isn't just a plant; it's part of Indian culture. Every garden benefits from that evening fragrance.

**Cost:** ₹60-150 per plant

## Seasonal Bloomers: Perennials with Defined Flowering Periods

These perennials have specific bloom seasons, followed by rest periods. Plan accordingly to stagger blooms throughout the year.

### Roses

**Blooming season:** Two main flushes in most of India:
- **Spring flush (February-April):** Peak blooms, best quality flowers
- **Fall flush (October-November):** Second wave, often more abundant than spring

**Why they're seasonal:** Roses need cool nights (15-20°C) to form flower buds. Mumbai's year-round warmth reduces bloom cycles. North India's temperature swings provide ideal conditions.

**Care essentials:**
- Full sun (6-8 hours minimum)
- Well-draining, rich soil (heavy feeders)
- Regular deadheading after blooms fade
- Pruning in late January (North India) or June (Mumbai) to stimulate new growth
- Weekly feeding during bloom periods

**Best varieties for India:** Desi roses (hardy, disease-resistant), hybrid teas (large flowers), floribundas (cluster blooms)

**Cost:** ₹100-300 per plant

### Chrysanthemums (Guldaudi)

**Blooming season:** October-January (winter/cool season flowers)

**Why they're seasonal:** Short-day plants requiring 12+ hours darkness to initiate flowering. Natural bloom time is fall/early winter when days shorten.

**Growth habit:** Bushy, 30-90 cm tall depending on variety.

**Care essentials:**
- Full sun
- Well-draining soil
- Pinch growing tips May-August to encourage bushy growth and more flower buds
- Stop pinching in September to allow buds to develop
- Feed every 3-4 weeks March-September

**Why grow them:** Mums fill the gap when summer annuals finish and few other perennials bloom. Peak season coincides with Diwali—perfect for festive displays.

**Cost:** ₹40-100 per plant

### Gerbera Daisy

**Blooming season:** Peak blooms February-April and September-November. Sporadic blooms other months.

**Why they're beautiful:** Large, daisy-like flowers (8-12 cm diameter) in every color except blue. Excellent cut flowers lasting 7-10 days in vases.

**Growth habit:** Low-growing rosette, 30-45 cm tall.

**Care essentials:**
- Full sun (6+ hours)
- Well-draining soil essential—crown rot is common issue if soil stays wet
- Plant with crown slightly above soil level (never bury crown)
- Remove spent flowers regularly
- Divide clumps every 2-3 years

**Challenges:** Susceptible to crown rot, spider mites, and aphids. More demanding than hibiscus or ixora.

**Why grow them anyway:** Those colors. Gerberas produce some of the most vibrant, clean colors in the flower world.

**Cost:** ₹50-150 per plant

### Plumeria (Frangipani, Champa)

**Blooming season:** March-September in most of India.

**Why it's special:** Intensely fragrant, waxy flowers in white, yellow, pink, or red. Flowers used in temple offerings and leis. Sculptural form when not blooming.

**Growth habit:** Small tree or large shrub, 2-6 meters tall. Deciduous—loses leaves in winter (normal, not death).

**Care essentials:**
- Full sun essential
- Well-draining soil (succulent-like care)
- Water moderately during growing season
- Minimal water during winter dormancy
- Feed every 6-8 weeks during active growth

**Dormancy:** Drops all leaves in winter (November-February). Looks dead but isn't. Resume watering when new growth appears in March.

**Propagation:** Easy from cuttings. Cut 30-45 cm branch, let dry 1 week, plant in sandy soil.

**Why grow it:** That fragrance in morning. Plus, plumeria tolerates drought and neglect—perfect for low-maintenance gardeners.

**Cost:** ₹100-300 per plant

## Strategic Planting: Combining Perennials for Year-Round Color

**The mistake most beginners make:** Planting only year-round bloomers OR only seasonal bloomers. Result: Either monotonous (same flowers always) or bare patches (seasonal bloomers resting simultaneously).

**Better strategy: Layer blooming periods**

### Foundation Layer (Year-Round Bloomers)

Plant these first—they're your garden's backbone:
- Hibiscus (daily blooms)
- Ixora (continuous clusters)
- Periwinkle (ground cover, nonstop flowers)

**Purpose:** Ensure garden NEVER looks completely bare.

### Seasonal Accent Layer

Add these for peak-season drama:
- Roses (spring and fall spectaculars)
- Chrysanthemums (winter color)
- Gerbera daisies (spring/fall highlights)

**Purpose:** Create seasonal interest without relying entirely on annuals.

### Filler Layer (Annuals)

Use fast-blooming annuals to fill gaps:
- Petunias (winter/spring in Mumbai, summer in North India)
- Zinnias (monsoon when many perennials rest)
- Marigolds (winter festivals)

**Purpose:** Provide color during perennial rest periods or while young perennials establish.

### Example Combination (Small Mumbai Balcony)

**Permanent plantings (perennials):**
- 2 hibiscus plants (different colors)
- 3 ixora plants (hedge/border)
- 6-8 periwinkle plants (ground cover/pot edges)
- 1 jasmine vine (trellis for fragrance)

**Seasonal rotations (annuals):**
- October-March: Petunias in gaps
- April-June: Portulaca (heat-tolerant annual)
- July-September: Impatiens (monsoon annual)

**Result:** Color 365 days. Minimal replanting (only annuals). Perennials handle themselves.

## Perennial Care Fundamentals

### First-Year Patience (The Hardest Part)

**What beginners expect:** Plant perennial, get flowers immediately.

**What actually happens:** 
- Year 1: Minimal or no flowers. Plant focuses on root establishment.
- Year 2: Moderate flowering. Plant gaining strength.
- Year 3+: Peak performance. Mature root system supports abundant blooms.

**The saying:** "First year they sleep, second year they creep, third year they leap."

**Exception:** Nursery-bought perennials in 1-2 year old pots may bloom immediately because roots are already established.

### Watering Strategy

**Different from annuals:** Perennials develop deep root systems. Encourage this by watering deeply but less frequently.

**Technique:**
- Water until moisture reaches 15-20 cm depth
- Let top 5-8 cm dry between waterings
- Avoid daily light sprinkles (encourages shallow roots)

**Frequency:**
- Summer: Every 2-3 days for most perennials
- Monsoon: Minimal supplemental watering
- Winter: Weekly or less

### Feeding Schedule

**Less is more:** Over-fertilizing perennials causes lush foliage but reduced flowering.

**Recommended schedule:**
- **Spring (March-April):** Balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) to support new growth
- **Growing season (April-October):** Bloom-focused fertilizer (low nitrogen, higher phosphorus—like 5-10-5) every 4-6 weeks
- **Winter (November-February):** No feeding (let plants rest)

**Organic options:**
- Vermicompost: Top-dress 2-3 handfuls per plant every 2 months
- Bone meal: Phosphorus for flowering, 2 tablespoons per plant in spring
- Banana peel tea: Potassium for flower quality, every 2 weeks during bloom period

### Pruning and Deadheading

**Deadheading:** Remove spent flowers to encourage more blooms. Critical for roses, hibiscus, gerberas. Less important for periwinkle, ixora (self-cleaning).

**Annual pruning:** Late winter (February) ideal timing for most perennials:
- Cut back dead growth
- Shape plants
- Remove 1/3 of old growth on woody perennials
- Stimulates vigorous spring growth

**Don't prune:** Avoid heavy pruning during active blooming or in extreme heat/cold.

### Division and Rejuvenation

**When to divide:** Every 3-4 years for clumping perennials (gerbera, chrysanthemums, periwinkle). Signs division is needed:
- Flowering declines
- Center of clump dies out
- Plant outgrows space

**How to divide:**
1. Dig up entire clump in late winter or early spring
2. Shake off loose soil
3. Pull or cut clump into 3-5 sections (each with roots and shoots)
4. Replant immediately in amended soil
5. Water well

**Result:** Rejuvenated plants bloom vigorously. Plus, free plants to expand garden or share.

## Growing Perennials in Pots

**Myth:** Perennials need in-ground planting.

**Reality:** Many perennials thrive in pots with proper care.

### Best Potted Perennials

**Excellent pot performers:**
- Hibiscus (compact varieties)
- Ixora
- Roses (especially miniature and floribunda types)
- Jasmine
- Periwinkle
- Begonias
- Gerbera daisies

**Challenging in pots:**
- Large shrubs (bougainvillea, plumeria)—need very large containers
- Aggressive spreaders

### Pot Requirements

**Size:** Minimum 12-15 inches diameter and depth for most flowering perennials. Larger is better—more soil = less watering, more stable temperatures.

**Drainage:** Non-negotiable. Drainage holes essential. Add 1-2 inch layer of broken pot pieces or gravel at bottom.

**Soil mix:** Use well-draining potting mix, not garden soil:
- 40% cocopeat
- 30% vermicompost
- 30% garden soil or perlite

### Potted Perennial Care Adjustments

**Watering:** Pots dry faster. Check soil daily. Water when top 3-5 cm feels dry.

**Feeding:** Nutrients leach from pots faster. Feed every 3-4 weeks (more frequent than in-ground).

**Repotting:** Every 2-3 years, repot into fresh soil. If rootbound, move to larger pot or divide plant.

**Winter protection:** Pots offer less insulation. In North India, move tender perennials indoors or against warm wall during coldest weeks.

## Mumbai and Indian Home Gardener Notes

### Climate Zone Considerations

**Tropical zones (Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, coastal areas):**
- Year-round growing season for most perennials
- Challenge: Maintaining bloom intensity during extreme summer heat (April-May)
- Solution: Provide afternoon shade, increase watering, mulch soil

**Subtropical zones (Delhi, Jaipur, Lucknow, North India):**
- Definite seasons with winter dormancy for many perennials
- Challenge: Protecting tender perennials from winter cold (below 10°C)
- Solution: Mulch roots heavily, move pots indoors, select cold-hardy varieties

### Monsoon Management (June-September)

**Advantages:** Natural rainfall, high humidity perfect for most perennials

**Challenges:**
- Fungal diseases (powdery mildew, black spot)
- Root rot if drainage poor
- Flower damage from heavy rain

**Solutions:**
- Ensure excellent drainage
- Increase air circulation (space plants appropriately)
- Move potted plants under overhangs during heavy downpours
- Apply preventative neem oil spray monthly

### Summer Heat (March-May)

**Challenges:**
- Rapid soil drying
- Leaf scorch
- Reduced flowering even in year-round bloomers

**Solutions:**
- Mulch soil surface (5-8 cm layer of leaf litter or coco chips)
- Water early morning and late evening
- Provide shade cloth (30-50% shade) during hottest hours for sensitive perennials
- Avoid fertilizing during extreme heat

### Local Sourcing

**Where to buy in India:**
- Crawford Market (Mumbai), Lalbagh Nursery (Bangalore), Nehru Place nurseries (Delhi)
- Online: Ugaoo, Nurserylive, Plantsguru, All That Grows
- Local nurseries: Often cheaper, plants already acclimatized

**What to look for:**
- Healthy foliage (no yellowing or pests)
- Multiple shoots/branches (bushier plants)
- Root health (check drainage holes—white roots good, black/mushy bad)
- Avoid: Rootbound plants with roots circling pot bottom excessively

### Typical Costs (India, 2026)

- Small periwinkle, ixora: ₹20-60
- Medium hibiscus, jasmine: ₹80-200
- Established roses: ₹100-300
- Specialty varieties (plumeria, gerbera): ₹100-400

**Value calculation:** ₹100 perennial that blooms for 5 years = ₹20/year. Compare to replanting annuals 3x/year at ₹30/plant = ₹90/year. Perennials save money long-term.

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Perennial Not Blooming

**Causes:**
1. **First-year plant** - Normal, blooming resumes year 2-3
2. **Insufficient sun** - Most flowering perennials need 6+ hours
3. **Too much nitrogen** - Switch to bloom fertilizer (low N, high P-K)
4. **Needs division** - Overcrowded clumps reduce flowering
5. **Recently transplanted** - Skip one season, bloom next year

**Solutions:** Identify cause, adjust accordingly. Be patient—perennials often skip one season after stress before resuming.

### Yellowing Leaves

**Causes:**
1. **Overwatering** - Soil constantly soggy
2. **Underwatering** - Soil bone dry, leaves crispy
3. **Iron deficiency** - Especially in alkaline soil (ixora, jasmine)
4. **Natural leaf drop** - Normal lower leaf shedding as plant grows

**Solutions:** Adjust watering. For iron deficiency, apply chelated iron or acidify soil with sulfur.

### Leggy Growth, Few Flowers

**Causes:**
1. **Insufficient light** - Plant stretching toward light source
2. **Not pinching/pruning** - Especially periwinkle, chrysanthemums
3. **Over-fertilizing with nitrogen**

**Solutions:** Move to sunnier spot. Prune back leggy growth. Pinch tips regularly. Reduce nitrogen fertilizer.

### Pests

**Common perennial pests:**
- **Aphids** (soft-bodied, clustered on new growth): Spray with strong water jet, apply neem oil
- **Spider mites** (tiny, webbing under leaves): Increase humidity, spray with water, neem oil
- **Mealybugs** (white cottony masses): Remove with alcohol-soaked cotton swab, spray neem oil
- **Caterpillars** (holes in leaves): Hand-pick, use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) organic spray

**Prevention:** Regular inspection, neem oil spray every 2-3 weeks during growing season, encourage beneficial insects (ladybugs eat aphids).

### Fungal Diseases

**Powdery mildew** (white powder on leaves):
- Improve air circulation
- Avoid overhead watering
- Spray baking soda solution (1 tablespoon per liter water + few drops soap)

**Black spot** (black spots on leaves, yellowing):
- Remove affected leaves
- Avoid wetting foliage
- Spray fungicide (copper-based or neem)

## Action Checklist: Growing Perennials Successfully

### Do This Today
- Assess your garden space: full sun areas (6+ hours), partial shade (4-6 hours), shade (4 hours or less)
- Decide on garden goals: continuous year-round color (choose year-round bloomers) or seasonal drama (mix seasonal perennials)
- Make initial plant list matching your light conditions and climate zone
- Check existing perennials if any: do they need division, pruning, or feeding?

### Do This This Week
- Visit local nursery to see perennials in person and confirm which are available
- Purchase 3-5 perennials to start (mix of year-round and seasonal bloomers)
- Get appropriate pots (12-15 inches minimum) with drainage holes if growing in containers
- Prepare soil: Mix cocopeat, vermicompost, and garden soil
- Buy supplies: quality potting mix, balanced fertilizer, bloom fertilizer, bone meal

### Do This This Month
- Plant perennials with proper soil amendments
- Set up watering schedule based on plant needs and your climate
- Apply mulch layer around plants (if in-ground)
- Take "before" photos to track growth over time
- Mark calendar for first feeding (4 weeks after planting for new plants)

### Ongoing (Perennial Care Routine)
- **Weekly:** Check soil moisture (finger test 5 cm deep), deadhead spent flowers on roses and hibiscus
- **Monthly:** Feed during growing season (March-October), pest inspection, remove dead/yellowing leaves
- **Quarterly:** Prune if needed, check for overcrowding
- **Annually (February):** Major pruning, divide overcrowded clumps, repot containerized perennials, refresh top 5 cm soil with compost
- **Track blooming patterns:** Note which months each perennial blooms to plan future additions for gaps
