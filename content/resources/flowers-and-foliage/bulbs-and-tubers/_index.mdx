faqs:
  - q: "What's the difference between bulbs, corms, tubers, and rhizomes?"
    a: "Bulbs (like amaryllis) are layered underground storage organs. Corms (like gladiolus) are solid, compressed stems. Tubers (like dahlia, caladium) are swollen roots or stems storing nutrients. Rhizomes (like canna lily) are horizontal underground stems. All function similarly—storing energy for the plant—but structurally different."
  
  - q: "When should I plant gladiolus bulbs in Mumbai?"
    a: "September-November is ideal in Mumbai when temperatures drop below 25°C. This gives corms cool conditions for root development. Blooms appear 60-90 days after planting (December-February). Avoid planting during peak summer (April-June) or monsoon (July-August)."
  
  - q: "Do I need to dig up and store bulbs every year?"
    a: "Depends on the type. Hardy bulbs (amaryllis, canna lily) can stay in ground year-round in most Indian climates. Tender bulbs (gladiolus, dahlia) should be lifted 10-12 weeks after flowering, dried, treated with fungicide, and stored in cool, dry place until next planting season for best results."
  
  - q: "Why didn't my bulbs bloom this year?"
    a: "Common causes: planted at wrong depth (too deep or shallow), insufficient chilling period for temperate bulbs, bulbs too small or old (exhausted), planted in heavy clay soil with poor drainage, or not enough sunlight (most need 6+ hours). Check planting depth first—it's the most common error."
  
  - q: "How deep should I plant bulbs?"
    a: "General rule: plant bulbs at depth 2-3 times their height. Small gladiolus corms (2-3 cm diameter): 6-10 cm deep. Large dahlia tubers (5-6 cm): 10-15 cm deep. Pointed end faces up. Mark depth with finger on trowel to ensure consistency."
  
  - q: "Can I grow bulbs in pots or only in ground?"
    a: "Most bulbs grow excellently in pots with proper container size. Use pots at least 12-15 inches deep for gladiolus or dahlia, 8-10 inches for smaller bulbs. Ensure drainage holes. Pots actually make lifting and storage easier and give you control over soil quality."

The first time I planted gladiolus corms, I followed a YouTube video that said "plant them like onions." So I stuck them in the ground pointing-side-up, watered religiously, and waited for those gorgeous flower spikes everyone raved about.

Eight weeks later: nothing. Not even leaves. I dug one up to check if it had rotted—it hadn't. It had sprouted, but the sprout was growing sideways underground, struggling to find the surface because I'd planted the corm upside down.

Turns out "pointed end up" isn't just a suggestion. It's the difference between flowers and frustration.

That failure taught me something valuable: bulbs and tubers are forgiving about many things (irregular watering, mediocre soil, benign neglect), but they're unforgiving about a few critical details. Get those details right, and you'll have some of the most spectacular, lowest-maintenance flowers in your garden.

This guide covers those non-negotiable details alongside everything else you need to grow gladiolus, dahlia, caladium, and other bulbous beauties successfully in Indian conditions.

## Understanding Bulbs, Corms, Tubers, and Rhizomes

These are all underground storage organs that help plants survive dormant periods, but they're structurally different.

### True Bulbs

Think onions—layers of fleshy scales surrounding a central growing point. Examples: Amaryllis, lilies (true lilies, not canna lilies).

Cut a bulb in half, and you see distinct layers. Each scale is a modified leaf storing nutrients. New bulbs (offsets) form alongside the mother bulb underground.

### Corms

Solid, compressed underground stems (not layered like bulbs). Examples: Gladiolus, crocus.

Corms look like bulbs from outside but are uniform inside—no layers. Each year, the plant produces a new corm on top of the old one, which shrivels up.

### Tubers

Swollen underground stems or roots storing nutrients. Examples: Dahlia (root tubers), caladium (stem tubers), potato (stem tubers, though we don't grow those for flowers).

Tubers have "eyes" (growth buds) from which shoots emerge. No protective layers. More prone to rotting if stored incorrectly.

### Rhizomes

Horizontal underground stems that send up shoots and roots from nodes. Examples: Canna lily, ginger.

Rhizomes spread laterally underground, creating new plants along their length. You can see distinct segments with visible nodes.

**For this guide's purposes:**

The planting and care principles are similar across these types. When I say "bulbs," I'm often referring collectively to all these underground storage organs unless specifying otherwise. The key distinction that matters practically is hardy vs. tender (whether they need lifting and storage).

## Why Grow Bulbs and Tubers?

**Spectacular flowers:** Gladiolus spikes reach 3-4 feet tall with 10-20 flowers per spike. Dahlia blooms can be as large as dinner plates. Few annuals or perennials match this drama.

**Low maintenance:** Plant once, water occasionally, wait. Bulbs come pre-loaded with nutrients for the first season. They don't need much from you.

**Return on investment:** One gladiolus corm (₹10-15) multiplies into 3-4 corms after one season. Plant those, get 9-12 corms the following year. Soon you have enough to fill an entire bed or share with neighbors—all from one initial investment.

**Seasonal flexibility:** Plant cool-season bulbs (gladiolus, dahlia) September-November for winter blooms. Tropical bulbs (caladium, canna) thrive in monsoon. You can have bulbous color almost year-round with planning.

**Excellent cut flowers:** Gladiolus lasts 7-10 days in vases. Dahlia blooms are stunning in arrangements. Growing your own means armfuls of cut flowers for ₹10 per corm instead of ₹200+ per bunch from florists.

**The tradeoff:**

Most tender bulbs require lifting, drying, and storage after flowering if you want them to return. That's extra work compared to "plant and forget" perennials. But the process takes maybe 2 hours once a year for a small collection, and many gardeners (myself included) find it meditative.

## Top Bulbs and Tubers for Indian Home Gardens

### Gladiolus (Sword Lily)

**What it is:** Tall, elegant flower spikes (60-150 cm) in virtually every color. Classic florist flower. Multiple blooms open progressively up the spike over 7-10 days.

**When to plant:** September-November in plains (Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad), February-March in hills (Shimla, Ooty). Temperature should be 10-25°C for best root development.

**How to plant:**
- Depth: 10-15 cm (about 3x corm height)
- Spacing: 15-20 cm apart
- Location: Full sun (6-8 hours minimum)
- Soil: Sandy loam, well-drained, pH 5.5-6.5
- Watering: Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged

**Blooming time:** 60-90 days after planting (varies by variety and temperature)

**Pro tip:** Plant corms every 10-15 days for 4-6 weeks rather than all at once. This gives you continuous blooms over 2-3 months instead of one big flush.

**Staking:** Essential. Flower spikes are tall and top-heavy. Use bamboo stakes (4-5 feet tall) inserted at planting time to avoid damaging roots later. Loosely tie stems to stakes as they grow.

**After flowering:** Let foliage yellow naturally (this feeds the corm for next season). Lift corms 10-12 weeks after flowering. Dry in shade 7-10 days. Treat with fungicide (Bavistin solution—follow package directions). Store in cool, dry, dark place in mesh bags or paper bags with ventilation.

**Cost:** ₹10-30 per corm (depending on variety and size)

### Dahlia

**What it is:** Show-stopping blooms ranging from 5 cm pompoms to 25 cm dinner-plate flowers. Colors include everything except true blue. Some varieties have cactus-like petals, others are perfectly spherical.

**When to plant:** September-November in Mumbai and warmer regions. February-March in cooler areas.

**How to plant:**
- Depth: 10-15 cm
- Spacing: 30-45 cm (they get bushy)
- Location: Full sun
- Soil: Rich, organic, well-drained
- Amendments: Mix generous amounts of well-rotted compost and vermicompost

**Blooming time:** 90-120 days after planting

**Special care:** Dahlias are heavy feeders. Apply balanced fertilizer every 3-4 weeks during growing season. Deadhead religiously for continuous blooming. Pinch tips when plants are 30 cm tall to encourage bushiness.

**Staking:** Necessary for tall varieties (60+ cm). Insert stake at planting time—dahlia tubers are clustered and easily damaged by stakes inserted later.

**After flowering:** Lift tubers 10-12 weeks after flowers finish. Cut stems to 10 cm above soil line before digging. Dry in shade 5-7 days. Dust with sulfur powder. Store in barely damp sand, sawdust, or vermiculite in cool, dark place. Check monthly—if too dry, lightly mist storage medium.

**The challenge:** Dahlias are more demanding than gladiolus. They need regular feeding, deadheading, and careful storage. But those blooms... worth it for many gardeners.

**Cost:** ₹30-80 per tuber (varies hugely by variety)

### Caladium

**What it is:** Grown for foliage, not flowers. Heart-shaped leaves in stunning combinations of pink, white, red, green, and silver. Flowers are insignificant and usually removed to keep energy in leaves.

**When to plant:** May-June with monsoon arrival. Caladiums love warmth and humidity.

**How to plant:**
- Depth: 5-8 cm (plant with bumpy side up—that's where shoots emerge)
- Spacing: 20-25 cm apart
- Location: Partial shade to full shade (bright indirect light indoors)
- Soil: Rich, well-drained, high in organic matter
- Moisture: Keep consistently moist during growing season (but not soggy)

**Growing season:** May-October in most of India

**Indoor growing:** Caladiums are excellent indoor plants for bright, indirectly lit spots. High humidity is appreciated—mist leaves occasionally or place pot on pebble tray with water.

**Dormancy:** Leaves die back in winter (November-February). This is natural. Reduce watering drastically once leaves yellow. Lift tubers, dry, and store, or leave in pots and store entire pot in cool, dry place. Resume watering in late April-May when temperatures warm up.

**Why I love them:** No other plant gives you this level of color in deep shade. While everyone else is struggling to find flowering plants for shaded balconies, caladium owners have vibrant pink-white-green displays.

**Cost:** ₹40-100 per tuber (larger tubers produce more leaves)

### Canna Lily

**What it is:** Large tropical plants (90-180 cm tall) with broad, often variegated leaves and orchid-like flowers in red, orange, yellow, or pink. Not a true lily—it's a rhizome.

**When to plant:** March-April for summer blooms, or June with monsoon

**How to plant:**
- Depth: 8-12 cm
- Spacing: 40-50 cm (they get huge)
- Location: Full sun to partial shade
- Soil: Rich, moist (cannas tolerate wetter conditions than most)
- Water: Generously—they're water-lovers

**Special characteristics:** Can handle poorly drained soil better than most bulbous plants. Actually thrives in consistently moist (even wet) soil. Perfect for those spots where drainage is challenging.

**Maintenance:** Remove spent flowers and seed pods. Cut back to ground level after flowering season ends. Rhizomes can stay in ground year-round in most Indian climates—they're quite cold-hardy (down to 0°C briefly).

**Multiplication:** Dig up clumps every 3-4 years in late winter. Divide rhizomes with a sharp knife (each division should have 2-3 growing eyes). Replant immediately.

**Bonus:** Besides flowers, foliage itself is architectural and beautiful. Some varieties have burgundy or striped leaves as attractive as any foliage plant.

**Cost:** ₹30-60 per rhizome

### Amaryllis

**What it is:** Large, trumpet-shaped flowers (15-20 cm across) on thick, hollow stems (30-60 cm tall). Red, pink, white, or orange. Each bulb produces 1-2 flower stalks with 4-6 flowers per stalk.

**When to plant:** December-January in Mumbai, November-December in North India

**How to plant:**
- Depth: Shallow—top 1/3 of bulb should remain above soil
- Pot size: 15-20 cm diameter (bulb should be 2-3 cm from pot edges)
- Location: Bright indirect light initially, then full sun once growth begins
- Soil: Well-draining, slightly sandy
- Water: Sparingly until shoots appear, then moderately

**Blooming time:** 6-8 weeks after planting

**After flowering:** Cut off flower stalk after blooms fade. Keep watering and feeding leaves for 5-6 months—this builds bulb strength for next year. Let leaves die back naturally in summer. Amaryllis can stay in same pot for 3-4 years—just top-dress with fresh compost annually.

**Forcing blooms for specific dates:** Want flowers for Diwali or Christmas? Count back 8 weeks, plant then. This is why amaryllis is popular for holiday forcing.

**Cost:** ₹150-400 per bulb (expensive but reusable for years)

## Planting Bulbs: The Critical Details

These are the non-negotiables I learned the hard way:

### Rule #1: Pointed End Up

With few exceptions, the pointed, tapered end of bulbs faces up. This is where the shoot emerges. The flat, sometimes slightly hairy end is the base where roots form.

**If you plant upside down:** Shoot must work extra hard to find surface, often failing or emerging late and weak. Flower production suffers dramatically.

**How to tell which end is which:** Gladiolus corms are fairly obvious—flatter bottom, pointed top. Dahlia tubers have visible "eyes" (bumps) where shoots emerge—these face up. Caladium tubers have a bumpy, knobbly side (that's the top) and a smoother side (bottom). When unsure, plant sideways—shoots will figure it out, just slower.

### Rule #2: Planting Depth Matters

**General rule:** 2-3 times the bulb's height.

**Examples:**
- Small gladiolus corm (2 cm tall): Plant 4-6 cm deep
- Large gladiolus corm (3 cm tall): Plant 6-10 cm deep
- Dahlia tuber (5 cm): Plant 10-15 cm deep
- Caladium tuber (3 cm): Plant 6-8 cm deep
- Amaryllis bulb: 1/3 above soil, 2/3 below

**Too shallow:** Bulbs dry out, topple over (especially tall gladiolus), or get exposed by rain/watering.

**Too deep:** Shoots struggle to reach surface. Bulbs rot in overly moist soil at depth. Flowering is delayed or fails.

**Pro tip:** Mark depth measurements on your trowel handle with permanent marker. Consistency is easier with a visual guide.

### Rule #3: Drainage is Non-Negotiable

Bulbs sitting in waterlogged soil rot within days. This is the #1 killer of bulbs.

**For pots:**
- Drainage holes are mandatory (not optional)
- Add 1-2 inch layer of broken pot pieces or gravel at bottom
- Use well-draining potting mix (50% cocopeat, 30% garden soil or sand, 20% vermicompost)
- Never let pots sit in water-filled saucers for more than 30 minutes

**For ground planting:**
- If your soil is heavy clay, don't plant bulbs directly
- Dig planting area 30-40 cm deep
- Mix in generous amounts of cocopeat, river sand, and compost
- Raised beds work beautifully for bulbs if drainage is persistently poor

**Test your drainage:** Dig a hole 30 cm deep, fill with water. If water drains in less than 4 hours, drainage is adequate. If still standing after 8 hours, you need major soil amendments or raised beds.

### Rule #4: Sunlight Requirements

Most flowering bulbs want full sun (6-8 hours minimum). Caladium is the exception—it prefers shade.

**Insufficient light:** Leaves grow, but flowering is poor or absent. Gladiolus may produce short spikes with few flowers. Dahlia blooms are small and sparse.

**Where this surprises people:** That "sunny" east-facing balcony that gets lovely morning light? It's only 3-4 hours of actual direct sun. Not enough for gladiolus or dahlia. Check sunlight hours honestly before committing to sun-loving bulbs.

## Seasonal Planting Calendar for Bulbs in India

**September-November (Post-Monsoon):**
- **Plant:** Gladiolus, dahlia
- **Why:** Cooling temperatures (below 25°C) trigger proper root development
- **Blooms:** December-February
- **Regions:** Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, all of South India

**December-January (Winter):**
- **Plant:** Amaryllis
- **Why:** Cool nights, warm days perfect for flower stalk development
- **Blooms:** January-March
- **Regions:** Most of India except coldest hill stations

**February-March (Late Winter/Early Spring):**
- **Plant:** Gladiolus (second planting in North India), dahlia (hills)
- **Why:** After harsh winter ends but before summer heat
- **Blooms:** April-June
- **Regions:** Delhi, Jaipur, Lucknow, all North Indian plains

**March-April (Spring):**
- **Plant:** Canna lily
- **Why:** Warming temperatures, approaching monsoon
- **Blooms:** May-August
- **Regions:** All of India

**May-June (Pre-Monsoon/Early Monsoon):**
- **Plant:** Caladium
- **Why:** Warmth + humidity triggers rapid growth
- **Foliation period:** June-October
- **Regions:** All of India with emphasis on humid areas

**July-August (Peak Monsoon):**
- **Plant:** Very little bulb planting—focus on maintaining existing plants
- **Why:** Excessive moisture promotes rot in dormant bulbs

## Fertilizing Bulbs and Tubers

Bulbs come pre-packaged with nutrients for their first flowering season, but supplemental feeding improves performance.

### At Planting Time

Mix into soil:
- 2-3 handfuls of vermicompost per planting hole
- 1 tablespoon bone meal per planting hole (phosphorus for root development)
- Avoid fresh manure (burns bulbs)—only well-rotted compost

### During Growing Season

**When shoots are 15-20 cm tall:**
- Apply balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half-strength
- Or sprinkle slow-release granular fertilizer according to package directions

**Every 3-4 weeks during active growth:**
- Liquid feed OR side-dress with compost
- Focus on phosphorus and potassium for flowering (NPK like 10-20-20)
- Reduce nitrogen (avoids excessive foliage at expense of flowers)

**After flowering:**
- Continue feeding leaves until they yellow naturally
- This replenishes bulb nutrients for next season
- Plants that don't get post-bloom feeding produce smaller bulbs and fewer flowers next year

### Homemade Options

- **Banana peel tea:** Soak peels in water 48 hours. Strain. Dilute 1:5. Water every 2 weeks. (Potassium-rich, promotes flowering)
- **Bone meal:** High phosphorus. Mix 1 tablespoon per plant into top 5 cm of soil.
- **Vermicompost tea:** Soak vermicompost in water 24 hours, strain, use undiluted. Balanced nutrition.

## Lifting, Curing, and Storing Bulbs

This is where many first-timers get intimidated. Don't be. It's straightforward once you've done it once.

### When to Lift

**Tender bulbs (gladiolus, dahlia):** 10-12 weeks after flowering finishes. Wait until foliage has yellowed 50-75%. Don't wait until completely dead—timing matters.

**Caladium:** After first frost or when temperatures consistently drop below 15°C (late October-November in most of India). Or when leaves start yellowing naturally.

**Hardy bulbs (amaryllis, canna lily):** Can stay in ground/pots year-round in most Indian climates. Only lift if dividing or moving.

### How to Lift

1. **Cut foliage** to 10-15 cm above ground (if not already yellowed)

2. **Dig carefully** with garden fork or spade, 15-20 cm away from plant base to avoid spearing bulbs

3. **Lift gently**, shaking off loose soil

4. **Inspect for damage** —discard any soft, moldy, or severely damaged bulbs

### Curing Process

**Purpose:** Allows outer layers to dry and toughen, sealing the bulb against moisture loss and disease during storage.

**Process:**

1. **Brush off excess soil** (don't wash—moisture promotes rot)

2. **Spread in single layer** on newspaper or cardboard in shaded, well-ventilated area (garage, covered porch, spare room)

3. **Cure duration:**
   - Gladiolus corms: 7-10 days
   - Dahlia tubers: 5-7 days
   - Caladium tubers: 3-5 days

4. **Signs of proper curing:** Outer skin feels papery and dry. Stems are fully dried and can be easily removed with gentle twist.

### Treating with Fungicide

**Why:** Prevents rot during storage—the biggest storage failure mode.

**How:**

Mix Bavistin (carbendazim) fungicide powder according to package directions (usually 2 grams per liter water). Dip bulbs for 5-10 minutes. Air dry completely before storage.

Alternative: Dust bulbs lightly with sulfur powder (organic option).

**Is it necessary?** Not absolutely, but highly recommended. The ₹50 spent on fungicide prevents losing ₹500+ worth of bulbs to rot.

### Storage Conditions

**Container:**
- Paper bags with ventilation holes, OR
- Mesh bags (onion bags work perfectly), OR
- Open cardboard boxes lined with newspaper

**Storage medium (for dahlia and caladium):**
- Slightly damp (not wet) peat moss, sawdust, or vermiculite
- These bulbs dry out easily and need barely moist medium
- Gladiolus and amaryllis store dry

**Temperature:** 10-18°C ideal. In Mumbai, an air-conditioned room is perfect. In North India, unheated spare rooms work.

**Darkness:** Store in dark place (closet, cupboard, drawer)

**Humidity:** Low humidity preferred. Avoid damp basements.

**Duration:** Until next planting season (typically 4-6 months)

### Monthly Checkups

Once a month, inspect stored bulbs:
- Discard any showing soft spots or mold
- If dahlia/caladium tubers are shriveling, lightly mist storage medium (very light—not wet)
- Remove any sprouting bulbs and plant immediately (or refrigerate to delay sprouting)

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Bulbs Aren't Blooming

**Possible causes:**

1. **Planted too deep or shallow** - Dig one up and check depth. Replant correctly.

2. **Insufficient chilling** - Some temperate bulbs (tulips, daffodils) need cold period (4-8 weeks at 4-8°C). In Mumbai, pre-chill in refrigerator before planting.

3. **Bulbs too small** - Small, exhausted bulbs won't flower. Buy large, firm bulbs. Size matters.

4. **Not enough sun** - Move to sunnier location or accept that shady spots won't produce flowers with sun-loving bulbs.

5. **Bulbs exhausted** - If you didn't feed foliage after last flowering, bulbs didn't replenish nutrients. Replace or feed heavily this season.

### Bulbs Rotting in Storage

**Cause:** Too much moisture—either bulbs weren't dried properly or storage conditions are too humid.

**Solution:** Check remaining bulbs immediately. Discard any soft ones. Dry remaining bulbs in sun for 2-3 hours. Add moisture-absorbing material to storage containers (silica gel packets, dry rice in open containers near bulbs). Ensure storage area has air circulation.

### Short Flower Stalks

**Cause:** Usually insufficient water during stalk development (gladiolus) or not enough phosphorus.

**Solution:** Keep soil consistently moist (not wet) once buds form. Use bloom-focused fertilizer (higher middle number in NPK ratio).

### Leaves But No Flowers

**Cause:** Too much nitrogen in fertilizer, insufficient light, or bulbs planted at wrong time.

**Solution:** Switch to low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus fertilizer. Move to sunnier spot if possible. Check planting calendar and adjust timing next season.

### Bulbs Multiplying Too Much

**The "problem":** After 3-4 seasons, you have so many offsets/corms that they're overcrowded and flowering declines.

**Solution:** Dig up clumps. Separate all bulbs/corms. Discard smallest ones (too small to flower). Replant largest specimens with proper spacing. Share extras with neighbors/friends or sell in local gardening groups.

## Mumbai and Indian Home Gardener Notes

### Pre-Chilling Temperate Bulbs

Some bulbs sold in India (tulips, daffodils, hyacinth) are bred for temperate climates requiring cold winters. Mumbai doesn't provide this.

**Solution:** Pre-chill in refrigerator:
- Place bulbs in paper bag
- Refrigerate 6-8 weeks at 4-8°C (away from fruits—ethylene gas damages bulbs)
- Plant immediately after chilling
- Note: Success is moderate even with chilling in tropical zones—tulips may not naturalize

**Better bet:** Focus on tropical/subtropical bulbs (gladiolus, dahlia, canna, caladium) naturally adapted to Indian conditions.

### Dealing with Monsoon

June-September monsoon challenges dormant bulb storage and growing bulbs:

**For bulbs in storage:** Ensure storage area is dry. Check monthly for moisture damage. Use moisture-absorbing materials liberally.

**For growing bulbs (canna, established caladium):** Ensure pots have perfect drainage. Raise pots on feet so they don't sit in water. Move potted specimens under overhangs during heavy downpours if possible.

### Space Optimization for Balconies

**Layering:** Plant bulbs at different depths in same large pot. Deep-planted gladiolus at bottom (10-15 cm), shallow-planted bulbs above them (5-8 cm). They emerge at different times and don't compete.

**Succession planting:** Plant new gladiolus corms every 2 weeks for continuous 2-month bloom period instead of one 10-day spike.

**Pot size matters:** Don't go too small. Minimum 12 inches deep for gladiolus and dahlia, 10 inches deep for caladium. Wider pots allow planting multiple bulbs with proper spacing.

### Local Availability and Costs

**Where to buy:**
- Local nurseries (inspect bulbs personally—firmness matters)
- Crawford Market, Dadar (Mumbai)
- Online: Ugaoo, Nurserylive, KisanKraft, All That Grows

**Typical costs (Mumbai, 2026):**
- Gladiolus corms: ₹10-30 each (depending on size and variety)
- Dahlia tubers: ₹30-80 each (variety-dependent)
- Caladium tubers: ₹40-100 each
- Canna rhizomes: ₹30-60 each
- Amaryllis bulbs: ₹150-400 each

**What to look for when buying:**
- Firmness (squeeze gently—should feel solid, not soft or spongy)
- Size (larger bulbs = more flowers)
- No visible mold or dark spots
- No sprouts yet (unless planting immediately)

### Temperature Extremes

**Heat waves (March-May, 38-42°C):**
- Shade pots during peak heat hours (12-4 PM) if possible
- Increase watering frequency
- Mulch soil surface to retain moisture
- Gladiolus and dahlia struggle in extreme heat—this is why we plant them for winter blooms

**Cold snaps (North India, December-January, below 5°C):**
- Move pots of tender bulbs indoors or under cover
- Cover in-ground plantings with straw mulch
- Reduce watering in cold weather (bulbs rot more easily in cold, wet soil)

## Action Checklist: Growing Bulbs Successfully

### Do This Today
- Identify which season you're in and which bulbs are appropriate to plant now
- Assess your sun hours honestly (6-8 hours for gladiolus/dahlia, shade for caladium)
- Check your soil drainage or prepare pots with drainage holes
- Make a shopping list of 2-3 bulb types to try

### Do This This Week
- Buy bulbs from reputable source (inspect for firmness and size)
- Acquire supplies: Appropriate pots (12+ inches deep), well-draining potting mix, bone meal, vermicompost
- Get bamboo stakes if growing gladiolus or tall dahlia
- Purchase fungicide (Bavistin) for storage treatment later

### Do This This Month
- Plant bulbs at correct depth (2-3x bulb height, pointed end up)
- Mark planting date on calendar plus expected bloom date (60-90 days for gladiolus, 90-120 for dahlia)
- Set watering reminder (check soil daily initially)
- For gladiolus: plant new corms every 10-14 days for continuous blooms

### Ongoing (Throughout Growing Season)
- Water when soil feels dry 2 inches deep (more frequent in hot weather)
- Fertilize every 3-4 weeks once shoots emerge
- Stake tall plants as they grow
- Deadhead spent flowers (doesn't apply to caladium)
- After flowering: Keep watering foliage until it yellows (feeds bulb for next season)

### After Flowering (End of Season)
- Lift tender bulbs 10-12 weeks after flowering
- Cure bulbs 5-10 days in shade with good air circulation
- Treat with fungicide and dry completely
- Store in cool, dark, dry place with proper containers
- Check monthly for rot or excessive drying
- Mark calendar for next planting season
