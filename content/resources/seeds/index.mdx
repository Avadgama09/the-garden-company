faqs:
  - q: "Which seeds germinate fastest for beginners in India?"
    a: "Coriander, radish, spinach, and amaranth germinate within 5-7 days in Indian conditions. Okra and methi (fenugreek) also sprout quickly, making them perfect confidence-builders for first-time gardeners."
  
  - q: "Can I use kitchen vegetable seeds for planting?"
    a: "Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Seeds from tomatoes, chillies, and gourds often work if the vegetable is fully ripe and not F1 hybrid. Seeds from store-bought capsicum and many packaged vegetables usually fail because they're harvested unripe or are sterile hybrids."
  
  - q: "How do I know if old seeds are still good?"
    a: "Float test is quickest: place seeds in water for 15 minutes. Good seeds sink, dead seeds float. For certainty, do a paper towel germination test with 10 seeds—if 7-8 sprout, the batch is still viable."
  
  - q: "Why do my seeds sprout but seedlings die within a week?"
    a: "This is damping off, caused by fungal infection in overly wet soil. Use sterile seed-starting mix (not garden soil), water from bottom or with a spray bottle, ensure good air circulation, and avoid overwatering. Sunlight exposure also helps prevent fungus."
  
  - q: "What's the best soil mix for starting seeds in Mumbai?"
    a: "Equal parts cocopeat, vermicompost, and garden soil with 10% perlite works perfectly. This stays moist without getting soggy, provides initial nutrition, and allows delicate roots to penetrate easily. Avoid heavy garden soil alone—it compacts and suffocates seedlings."
  
  - q: "Do all seeds need to be soaked before planting?"
    a: "No. Hard-coated seeds like bottle gourd, ridge gourd, moringa, and beans benefit from 12-24 hour soaking. But small seeds like coriander, lettuce, and most flowers should be planted directly—soaking makes them slimy and difficult to handle."
  
  - q: "When is the best time to start seeds in Mumbai?"
    a: "October-November for winter crops (tomato, cabbage, carrot, spinach) and February-March for summer crops (okra, gourds, amaranth, chillies). Monsoon season (June-September) is tricky—high humidity causes fungal issues, so start seeds indoors with good air circulation."
  
  - q: "How deep should I plant different seeds?"
    a: "General rule: plant seeds at depth 2-3 times their width. Tiny seeds (lettuce, petunia) just press onto moist soil surface. Medium seeds (tomato, brinjal) go 0.5-1 cm deep. Large seeds (beans, gourds) need 1-2 cm depth. Too deep and they won't reach light; too shallow and they dry out."

I remember the first time I tried growing vegetables from seeds on my Mumbai balcony. I planted tomato seeds directly into a big pot filled with garden soil, watered them enthusiastically every day, and waited. After two weeks, I had exactly three weak, pale seedlings struggling to survive in compacted, waterlogged soil. Most of the seeds never germinated, and the ones that did looked like they regretted the decision.

That's when I learned that seeds aren't just "put in soil and add water." They're living things waiting for the right conditions to wake up. Temperature, moisture, light, soil texture, planting depth—every detail matters. The good news? Once you understand what seeds actually need, growing from seed becomes not just possible, but deeply satisfying and far more affordable than buying endless nursery plants.

This guide covers everything you need to know about seeds for Indian home gardening—from choosing the right varieties for Mumbai's heat and humidity, to germination techniques that actually work in tropical conditions, to saving your own seeds for next season. Whether you have a balcony railing or a full terrace, let's get your seeds off to a strong start.

## Why Start From Seeds Instead of Buying Plants

Most gardeners in Indian cities start with nursery seedlings—and that's fine for your first few plants. But growing from seed opens up a completely different world.

**Variety is the biggest advantage.** Your local nursery might stock five tomato varieties; seed catalogs have fifty. Want purple carrots, Thai basil, heirloom brinjals, or butter lettuce? Seeds are often your only option. Specialty vegetables and herbs that command high prices in gourmet stores—microgreens, exotic salad greens, unusual chillies—are remarkably cheap to grow from seed at home.

**Cost savings add up fast.** A tomato seedling costs ₹20-30 at Mumbai nurseries. A seed packet with 50 seeds costs ₹40-60. That's ₹1 per plant instead of ₹25. For someone growing 20-30 vegetable plants per season, you're looking at savings of ₹400-600 every planting cycle.

**Timing control is underrated.** Nurseries sell what's popular when they decide to grow it. Growing from seed means you plant exactly when your space is ready, exactly which varieties you want, exactly how many plants you need. No more buying six brinjal seedlings because they come in a tray when you only have space for two.

Seeds let you see the complete lifecycle. There's something powerful about watching a hard, dry seed crack open, push through soil, unfurl its first leaves, and eventually produce flowers and fruit. It connects you to the process in a way buying a six-inch tall plant never does.

## Understanding Seed Types: What to Buy for Indian Gardens

Not all seeds are equal, and knowing what you're buying makes a real difference in results.

**Open-pollinated (OP) seeds are traditional varieties** that breed true—meaning if you save seeds from your harvest, they'll grow plants identical to the parent. These are the seeds your grandparents' generation used. They're genetically stable, often locally adapted, and perfect for seed saving. Many Indian heirloom vegetables like desi tomatoes, local brinjal varieties, and traditional gourds are open-pollinated.

**Hybrid (F1) seeds are created by crossing two parent varieties** to produce offspring with specific desired traits—higher yield, disease resistance, uniform size, faster maturity. F1 hybrids perform reliably and often outproduce traditional varieties. The catch: seeds saved from F1 plants don't breed true. Second-generation plants are unpredictable, often reverting to less desirable traits. For home gardeners, this means you need to purchase fresh F1 seeds each season.

**Heirloom seeds are open-pollinated varieties** passed down through generations, often 50+ years old. They're valued for flavor, local adaptation, and biodiversity. Many heirloom seeds perform exceptionally well in specific regions because they've been selected by farmers in those conditions over decades. For Mumbai gardeners, seeds adapted to coastal tropical climates—like Konkan region vegetables—often outperform imported varieties.

**Organic vs. conventional seeds:** Organic seeds come from plants grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. The seed itself is essentially the same, but organic seed production supports sustainable agriculture. For home gardens, this distinction matters less than seed quality and variety suitability. A conventionally-grown but locally-adapted seed will often outperform an organic but poorly-suited variety.

**Treated vs. untreated seeds:** Some commercial seeds are coated with fungicide (often bright pink or blue) to prevent damping off disease. These chemicals help in commercial agriculture but aren't necessary for careful home gardeners. Untreated seeds are fine if you use sterile seed-starting mix and proper watering technique.

**What to buy for Mumbai conditions:** Look for heat-tolerant, humidity-resistant varieties. Many international seed companies breed for temperate climates—their "summer" is 25°C, while Mumbai's summer hits 35-38°C. Indian seed companies like Seeds of India, Sahaja Seeds, and Pabhoi Greens offer varieties selected for tropical conditions. Local nurseries in Mumbai often stock seeds that have proven themselves in the city's specific microclimate.

## Choosing the Right Seeds for Each Season

Mumbai has two summers, a heavy monsoon, and a brief winter. Your seed choices need to work with this reality.

**Winter season (October to February)** is Mumbai's most productive growing period. Daytime temperatures sit at 25-30°C, nights cool to 18-20°C, humidity drops, and there's no rain to complicate things.

Start tomatoes, brinjal, chillies, and capsicum indoors in October. These heat-loving plants need 3-4 months to fruit, so starting in October means harvest peaks in January-February before the pre-monsoon heat wave.

Direct-sow quick-growing crops: coriander, spinach, methi (fenugreek), radish, and amaranth. These germinate in cool soil and grow fast. You'll harvest within 30-45 days, and you can succession plant every two weeks through December.

Cool-season vegetables like carrots, beetroot, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, and peas thrive November through January. These struggle in heat but love Mumbai's winter. Start them from seed in November for January-February harvest.

**Summer season (March to May)** is challenging. Temperatures climb to 35-38°C, humidity builds, and many vegetables stress or bolt (go to seed prematurely). But several crops actually thrive in this heat.

Okra (bhindi) is the summer hero—it loves heat, tolerates humidity, and produces prolifically. Start seeds in February-March for April-June harvest.

Gourds, gourds, gourds. Bottle gourd (lauki), ridge gourd (torai), bitter gourd (karela), snake gourd (padwal), and cucumber all love Mumbai's hot season. Start in February or March. They need space and support but reward you with abundant harvest.

Amaranth (chowli) is a heat-loving leafy green. Unlike spinach which bolts immediately in heat, amaranth thrives at 35°C. Direct sow seeds every two weeks March through May for continuous greens harvest.

**Monsoon season (June to September)** is high-risk, high-humidity season. Fungal diseases explode, soil stays wet, and seeds can rot before germinating. But it's also when certain crops thrive.

For monsoon planting, start seeds indoors or under cover, not in open ground. Use well-draining mix heavy on cocopeat and perlite. Fungal spores thrive in stagnant moisture, so air circulation is critical.

Leafy greens like spinach, methi, and coriander can work if you're careful about drainage and air flow. They appreciate the cooler monsoon temperatures but hate waterlogged roots.

Some gardeners successfully grow beans and okra during early monsoon (June-July) if they have good drainage and disease-resistant varieties.

**What about year-round crops?** Chillies, curry leaves, mint, and basil can be started almost any time in Mumbai. They're forgiving about season and continuously productive once established.

## Mumbai and Indian Home Gardener Notes on Seasonal Seed Starting

The printed seed packets often give sowing times for North Indian plains or temperate climates. For Mumbai specifically:

- Winter crop seeds (tomato, brinjal, capsicum) need to start in October, not November or December. By December, it's too late for them to fully mature before March heat sets in.

- Summer crops can be started as early as late February. Mumbai's "spring" is essentially non-existent—temperatures jump from pleasant to hot quickly.

- Monsoon planting requires covered seed starting. An open balcony without rain protection will drown your seedlings.

- If you're elsewhere in India: Bangalore and Pune have cooler, drier conditions—their growing windows are longer. Chennai and Kolkata have similar humidity challenges as Mumbai. North India has distinct seasons allowing true winter crops (broccoli, Brussels sprouts) that won't form properly in Mumbai's mild winter.

- Altitude matters enormously. Hill stations like Ooty, Kodaikanal, Shimla, or even Lonavala can grow temperate crops (strawberries, European lettuce varieties, sweet peas) that fail in Mumbai. If you're gardening above 1000m elevation, you can follow seed packet instructions written for Europe or Northern USA.

## Germination Techniques That Work in Indian Conditions

Germination is the process of a seed transitioning from dormant to active growth. It needs three things: moisture, warmth, and (for most species) oxygen. Some seeds also need light or darkness. Getting these conditions right is the difference between 90% germination and 20% germination.

**The direct sowing method** is simplest. Plant seeds directly where they'll grow—into pots or ground beds. This works well for plants that dislike transplanting (root vegetables, gourds, beans, coriander) or for quick-growing crops where the extra time of transplanting isn't worth it.

Moisten soil before planting. Scatter or place seeds at correct depth (2-3 times seed width). Cover lightly with seed-starting mix or fine soil. Water gently with spray bottle or can with rose head—strong stream washes seeds away or buries them too deep.

Keep soil consistently moist (not soaked) until germination. In Mumbai's heat, this might mean light watering twice daily. Once seedlings emerge, reduce frequency but water more deeply.

**The seed tray/seedling cup method** gives you control. Small containers filled with seed-starting mix let you create perfect germination conditions, then transplant strong seedlings to final location.

Use containers with drainage holes—yogurt cups, cut plastic bottles, nursery seedling trays, or proper seed trays all work. Fill with light, sterile seed-starting mix. Commercial mixes work, or make your own: 40% cocopeat, 40% vermicompost, 20% perlite.

Plant seeds at correct depth. Water from bottom (place tray in shallow water until surface is moist) or spray gently from top. Cover tray with clear plastic or humidity dome to maintain moisture until germination starts.

Place in warm spot—Mumbai's ambient temperature (28-32°C) is perfect for most vegetable seeds. Cooler homes might need a warm spot near (not on) a window, or even on top of the refrigerator.

Once seeds germinate, remove cover immediately and move to bright light. Seedlings need 4-6 hours direct sun or very bright indirect light. Without enough light, seedlings become "leggy"—tall, weak stems stretching toward light, prone to falling over.

Transplant when seedlings have 2-4 true leaves (not counting the first seed leaves/cotyledons). Water seedlings an hour before transplanting. Gently remove from seed tray, keeping root ball intact. Plant in final container or bed at same depth they were growing, or slightly deeper for tomatoes and brinjals (they root along the buried stem).

**The paper towel pre-germination method** is brilliant for expensive seeds, old seeds with uncertain viability, or hard-coated seeds that benefit from soaking. This is what I use for seeds I've saved or purchased from uncertain sources.

Moisten (don't soak) paper towel. Fold it over seeds. Place in ziplock bag or closed container. Keep in warm spot (25-30°C).

Check daily. Seeds should sprout within 3-10 days depending on species. The moment you see the tiny white root (radicle) emerging, it's time to plant. Use tweezers to gently transfer sprouted seed to moist soil, root pointing down. Cover lightly. The sprouted seed is delicate—handle only by the seed body, never by the emerging root.

This method lets you plant only viable seeds (saving space), and reduces time in soil (reducing fungal disease risk). I pre-germinate all my gourd seeds this way—bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ridge gourd all have thick seed coats that germinate inconsistently when direct-sown but sprout reliably with paper towel method.

**Soaking seeds: when and how long?** Hard-coated large seeds germinate faster after soaking: bottle gourd, ridge gourd, moringa, okra, beans, and gongura should soak 12-24 hours before planting. This softens the seed coat and triggers the germination process.

Use room-temperature water, not hot. Seeds should swell noticeably. Don't soak longer than 24 hours or they can rot. After soaking, plant immediately—don't let them dry out again.

Small seeds like tomato, chilli, lettuce, coriander, and flower seeds should not be soaked. They become slimy, difficult to handle, and prone to rot. Plant these directly.

**Temperature requirements by crop:** Most Indian vegetables germinate in Mumbai's ambient 25-30°C. But understanding preferences helps troubleshoot failures.

Cool-season crops (lettuce, spinach, carrots, peas) prefer 15-25°C. In Mumbai, this means germinating them October through January. Higher temperatures cause poor germination or none at all.

Warm-season crops (tomatoes, chillies, brinjal) prefer 20-30°C—perfect for Mumbai most of the year.

Hot-season crops (okra, gourds, amaranth) prefer 25-35°C and germinate poorly below 20°C. This is why okra seeds planted in January often fail—soil is too cool. Wait until late February when soil temperature rises.

**Darkness vs. light for germination:** Most vegetable seeds are indifferent—they germinate in light or dark. Some are specific:

Need light to germinate: lettuce, some petunias, alyssum. These should be pressed onto soil surface, not buried. Keep moist by covering with clear plastic until germination, then remove immediately.

Need darkness: tomato, brinjal, chilli, some flower seeds germinate best when covered. Standard planting depth (2-3 times seed width) naturally provides this.

## Common Germination Problems and How to Fix Them

Seeds not germinating at all? Check these in order:

**Old seeds have declining viability.** Seed viability varies by species. Onion seeds lose viability after one year. Tomato and brinjal stay viable 4-5 years if stored properly (cool, dry, dark, airtight). Beans and peas last 2-3 years. If your seeds are old, do a float test or germination test on 10 seeds before planting your whole packet.

**Planted too deep or too shallow.** Too deep and seedlings exhaust their energy reserves before reaching light. Too shallow and seeds dry out before germinating or get washed away during watering. Follow the 2-3 times seed width rule.

**Wrong temperature.** Lettuce seeds won't germinate at 35°C. Okra seeds won't germinate at 18°C. Match crop to season.

**Soil too dry or too wet.** Seeds need consistent moisture to germinate, but soggy soil cuts off oxygen and they rot. Soil should feel like a wrung-out sponge—moist but not dripping. In Mumbai's heat, check twice daily and mist if surface is drying.

**Seeds treated or damaged during storage.** If you're saving seeds from your own harvest, ensure they're completely dry before storing. Damp seeds grow mold in storage and die. Store in airtight containers with silica gel packets in cool, dark place.

**Damping off kills seedlings after germination.** You see seedlings emerge, then within 2-7 days they suddenly collapse at soil level and die. This is fungal disease caused by pathogens in soil, overcrowding, poor air circulation, or overwatering.

Prevention: Use sterile seed-starting mix (never untreated garden soil for starting seeds). Water from bottom or with fine spray. Thin crowded seedlings early—give each seedling space. Ensure good air circulation. Don't water at night in humid conditions. Once seedlings get true leaves and start growing strongly, they're usually past damping off risk.

If damping off appears, remove affected seedlings immediately. Stop watering for a day. Improve air circulation. Some gardeners spray remaining seedlings with dilute hydrogen peroxide solution (3% H2O2 diluted 1:10 with water), but prevention is far better than treatment.

**Leggy seedlings are tall, weak, and pale.** This is light starvation. Seedlings stretch toward insufficient light, producing long, thin stems that fall over easily and support few leaves.

Solution: More light, immediately. Move seedlings to brightest location—full direct sun for 4-6 hours minimum. If growing indoors, you need a bright south-facing window or grow lights. Rotate containers daily so seedlings grow straight. For already-leggy seedlings, you can bury stem deeper during transplanting (works for tomatoes, brinjals), or pinch and start over if they're too weak.

**Seeds germinate, but seedlings stop growing.** Usually nutrient deficiency. Seed-starting mix has minimal nutrition—enough for germination but not sustained growth. Once seedlings have 2-3 true leaves, they need feeding.

Transplant to nutrient-rich potting mix (garden soil + compost + cocopeat), or begin feeding with dilute liquid fertilizer (fish emulsion, seaweed extract, or dilute compost tea) once per week.

## Seed Starting Supplies: What You Actually Need

You can spend ₹50 or ₹5,000 on seed-starting supplies. Here's what matters:

**Containers with drainage holes.** Anything works—nursery trays (₹40-80 for 50-cell tray), plastic cups with holes poked in bottom, cut bottles, yogurt cups, egg cartons. Choose size based on how long seedlings stay before transplanting. For quick growers (coriander, radish) that transplant within 2 weeks, small cells are fine. For slow growers (tomatoes, chillies) that need 4-6 weeks, use larger containers (at least 100ml volume).

**Seed-starting mix.** This is worth buying or making properly. Garden soil alone compacts, stays too wet, and carries disease. Good seed-starting mix is light, fluffy, holds moisture without waterlogging, and is sterile.

Buy commercial: Coco & Coir, Trustbasket, or Kraft Seeds all make seed-starting mixes available online (₹200-400 for 5kg).

Make your own: Mix 40% cocopeat (provides structure, holds moisture), 40% vermicompost (provides nutrition), 20% perlite or coarse sand (improves drainage and aeration). Some gardeners use 50-50 cocopeat and vermicompost with excellent results.

**Watering tools.** Spray bottle or mister for initial watering of tiny seeds. Small watering can with rose head (the perforated nozzle that makes rain-like spray) for seedlings. Strong water stream disturbs seeds, washes them away, or compacts soil.

**Labels.** Trust me, you'll forget what you planted. Plastic plant labels (₹50 for 100), popsicle sticks with permanent marker, or cut plastic from old containers all work. Label each container with variety and date planted.

**Humidity cover.** Clear plastic sheet, ziplock bags, or commercial humidity domes keep moisture in until seeds germinate. Remove immediately once seedlings emerge to prevent fungal issues.

**Light source.** For most Mumbai homes, a sunny balcony or window sill provides enough light. If you're starting seeds indoors without bright sun, you need grow lights. LED grow lights are now affordable (₹600-2000) and effective.

**Optional but helpful:** Heat mat for germinating heat-loving seeds in winter (rarely needed in Mumbai). Seedling transplanter tool (chopstick or pencil works fine). Small fan for air circulation if growing indoors.

## Seed Saving: Growing Your Own Seeds for Next Year

Saving seeds connects you to thousands of years of agricultural tradition. Every vegetable you eat came from seeds that farmers saved, selected, and replanted. You can do the same.

**Why save seeds?** It's free. You're no longer dependent on seed companies or nurseries. You can select for traits you value—flavor, size, earliness, disease resistance, adaptation to your specific microclimate. Seeds you save from plants that thrived in your conditions will perform better next generation than seeds bred elsewhere.

**Which plants are easiest for seed saving?** Self-pollinating plants that produce dry seeds: tomatoes, brinjal (eggplant), chillies, beans, peas, lettuce, coriander, okra, and most flowers.

Self-pollinating means flowers fertilize themselves before opening, so seeds breed true without cross-pollination from other varieties. Tomatoes are perfect beginner seed-saving plants—each tomato contains dozens of seeds, and tomato varieties don't cross-pollinate easily.

**Which plants are harder?** Cross-pollinating plants where pollen from one variety can fertilize flowers of another variety: gourds (bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ridge gourd), cucumbers, melons, squash, and brassicas (cabbage, cauliflower, radish, mustard).

If you're growing multiple varieties, they'll cross. Your bottle gourd seeds might produce bottle gourd x ridge gourd hybrids with unpredictable characteristics. To save pure seeds from cross-pollinators, you need isolation distance (several hundred meters between varieties) or hand-pollination techniques. For home gardeners, just grow one variety per species if you want to save seeds.

**How to save tomato seeds:** Choose the best-tasting, healthiest tomato from your most productive plant. Let it ripen fully on the plant—beyond eating stage to very soft.

Cut tomato in half. Scoop seeds and gel into a small jar. Add equal amount of water. Label jar with variety name.

Leave jar loosely covered at room temperature for 2-4 days. The mixture will ferment—gel dissolves, good seeds sink, bad seeds and mold float. It will smell unpleasant. This is normal and necessary. Fermentation removes germination-inhibiting gel and kills many seed-borne diseases.

After fermentation, skim off floating material. Pour contents through fine strainer. Rinse seeds thoroughly under running water.

Spread clean seeds on paper towel or plate in single layer. Dry completely at room temperature away from direct sun—this takes 5-7 days in Mumbai. Seeds must be completely dry or they'll mold in storage. Test by trying to bend a seed—if it bends, it's not dry; if it snaps, it's ready.

Store in paper envelope or small jar labeled with variety and date. Keep in cool, dry, dark place. These seeds remain viable 4-6 years.

**How to save dry seeds (beans, peas, okra):** Leave pods on plant until completely dry. For beans and peas, pods turn brown and brittle. For okra, pods turn brown and split naturally.

Harvest dry pods. Open and remove seeds. Spread on paper for a few days to ensure complete dryness. Store in airtight container labeled with variety and date.

**How to save chilli and capsicum seeds:** Leave fruit on plant until fully ripe and starting to wrinkle. For chillies, this means red (or yellow/orange depending on variety). Capsicum also needs to change color—most turn red when fully ripe.

Cut open fruit. Scrape seeds into a container. Spread on paper plate or towel. Dry completely (7-10 days in Mumbai). Store labeled in airtight container. These remain viable 3-4 years.

**How to save brinjal seeds:** Let one or two brinjals go completely over-ripe on the plant. They'll turn dull, soft, and unappealing. This is correct—seeds aren't mature in the young, glossy brinjals we eat.

When brinjal is over-ripe, cut it open. Seeds are embedded in the flesh. You can ferment like tomatoes, or just rinse seeds clean, dry thoroughly, and store. Brinjal seeds remain viable 5-6 years.

**Seed saving from herbs:** Coriander, dill, fennel, and many herbs bolt (flower and go to seed) naturally. Let plants flower. When seed heads turn brown and dry, cut the entire stem. Hang upside down over paper or cloth—seeds will fall out as they dry. Collect, store labeled.

**Critical seed-saving rule:** Only save seeds from open-pollinated (OP) varieties, not F1 hybrids. F1 seeds produce unpredictable second-generation plants, often inferior to parents. Seed packets label hybrids as "F1" or "Hybrid." Open-pollinated varieties are labeled "OP," "Heirloom," or just don't mention hybrid.

**Storage tips:** Seeds hate heat, light, and moisture. Ideal storage is cool (below 20°C), dark, and dry. In Mumbai's humidity, use silica gel packets in storage containers to absorb moisture. Glass jars with tight lids work well. Label everything—you'll forget varieties within months.

Most vegetable seeds remain viable 3-6 years if stored properly. Onion seeds are exception—use within one year. Parsnip also loses viability quickly.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

**Mistake 1: Using garden soil for seed starting.** Garden soil compacts in containers, stays soggy, and harbors diseases. Seedlings struggle to push through heavy soil, and damping off disease kills them. Use light, fluffy seed-starting mix instead.

**Mistake 2: Planting seeds at wrong depth.** Tiny seeds buried 2cm deep never emerge. Large seeds barely covered dry out before sprouting. Remember: 2-3 times the seed's width is correct depth. When in doubt, plant shallower rather than deeper—you can always add a light soil sprinkle if seeds are exposed.

**Mistake 3: Overwatering.** This is the top killer of seedlings. Soggy soil cuts off oxygen to roots and promotes fungal disease. Soil should be moist like a wrung-out sponge, never dripping wet. Water when top 1cm feels dry, not on a fixed schedule.

**Mistake 4: Not enough light after germination.** Seeds germinate in dim light or darkness, but the moment seedlings emerge they need strong light. Insufficient light produces weak, leggy seedlings that fail at transplant. Move seedlings to brightest spot immediately after germination.

**Mistake 5: Wrong season planting.** Planting lettuce seeds in April in Mumbai will fail—it's too hot. Planting okra in December will fail—it's too cool. Match crop to appropriate season based on your local climate.

**Mistake 6: Not thinning seedlings.** When you direct-sow or scatter seeds, multiple seeds germinate close together. Leaving them crowded produces weak plants that compete for light, water, and nutrients. Thin ruthlessly to proper spacing—for most vegetables, this means 3-6 inches between plants minimum.

**Mistake 7: Disturbing roots during transplant.** Rough handling tears delicate root hairs and shocks seedlings. Water seedlings before transplanting (easier to remove from container). Handle by leaves, never stem or roots. Keep root ball intact. Plant immediately in moist soil at same depth they were growing.

**Mistake 8: Transplanting too early or too late.** Too early (before 2 true leaves) and seedlings haven't developed enough roots—transplant shock kills them. Too late (6-8 leaves in small containers) and roots circle the container, creating pot-bound plants that transplant poorly. Sweet spot is 2-4 true leaves.

**Mistake 9: No hardening off.** Seedlings started indoors are tender—full sun and wind shock them. Before transplanting outdoors, "harden off" by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions. Day 1-2: place outside in shade for 2-3 hours. Day 3-4: partial sun. Day 5-7: full outdoor conditions. Then transplant.

**Mistake 10: Saving seeds from F1 hybrids.** These produce unpredictable second-generation plants. If you want to save seeds, grow open-pollinated varieties.
