faqs:
  - q: "What is hydroponics in simple terms?"
    a: "Hydroponics is growing plants in water with dissolved nutrients instead of soil—roots absorb food directly from nutrient-rich water, which means faster growth, less water usage, and no soil-borne diseases."
  - q: "Which hydroponic system is best for beginners?"
    a: "The Kratky method is best for absolute beginners—it needs no electricity, no pumps, and no moving parts; just a container, water, nutrients, and a net pot. DWC (Deep Water Culture) is the next step up, adding an air pump for faster growth."
  - q: "What can I grow with hydroponics at home in India?"
    a: "Start with leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, pak choi), herbs (basil, mint, coriander), and then graduate to fruiting plants (tomatoes, chillies, cucumbers) once you're comfortable with pH and nutrient management."
  - q: "How much does a basic hydroponic setup cost in India?"
    a: "A simple Kratky setup costs ₹200–500 per plant; a DWC bucket system costs ₹800–1,500; a complete NFT system for 20–30 plants costs ₹5,000–12,000 depending on materials and whether you DIY or buy a kit."
  - q: "Is hydroponic food safe to eat?"
    a: "Yes—hydroponic produce is safe and often cleaner than soil-grown food because there's no soil contamination, fewer pesticides needed, and controlled growing conditions; many commercial salad greens sold in Indian supermarkets are already grown hydroponically."

## What hydroponics actually is (and why it works better than you'd expect)

I remember my first reaction when someone told me plants could grow without soil: "That can't be right. Plants *need* soil."

They don't. What plants actually need is water, nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients), light, oxygen at the roots, and structural support. Soil just happens to provide all of these in nature. But if you supply each one directly, soil becomes unnecessary.

That's hydroponics in one sentence: **giving plants exactly what they need, dissolved in water, without soil as the middleman.**

The result? Plants grow 30–50% faster, use up to 90% less water (because it's recirculated, not lost to ground drainage), and you eliminate soil-borne pests and diseases entirely. The trade-off is that *you* become responsible for everything the soil used to handle—pH balance, nutrient mixing, oxygen supply, and root support.

This guide covers the six main hydroponic systems, how nutrients and pH work, what equipment you need, what to grow first, and how to adapt everything for Indian home conditions.

## How hydroponics works (the core principles)

Every hydroponic system, no matter how complex, does the same four things:

### 1. Delivers water + dissolved nutrients to roots

Instead of roots searching through soil for scattered nutrients, you dissolve a precise nutrient mix directly into water. Roots absorb it immediately. No guesswork, no wasted fertilizer.

### 2. Provides oxygen to roots

Roots need oxygen to function. In soil, air pockets between particles supply it. In water, you must either:
- Use an air pump + air stone to bubble oxygen into the water (DWC, NFT)
- Leave an air gap so roots are partially exposed (Kratky)
- Mist roots directly with nutrient solution (Aeroponics)

Without oxygen, roots suffocate and rot within days. This is the #1 killer in beginner hydroponic setups.

### 3. Supports the plant physically

Without soil, plants need something to hold them upright. Common options:
- **Net pots + clay pebbles (LECA):** Most popular, reusable, good drainage
- **Rockwool cubes:** Common for seedlings, retains moisture well
- **Cocopeat / Coco coir:** Familiar to Indian gardeners, semi-hydroponic
- **Perlite / Vermiculite:** Lightweight, good aeration

### 4. Maintains correct pH and nutrient concentration

Plants absorb different nutrients at different pH levels. If pH drifts too far:
- **Below 5.0:** Micronutrient toxicity (too much iron, manganese)
- **Above 7.0:** Iron, manganese, zinc become unavailable (plants yellow despite having nutrients in water)
- **Sweet spot: 5.5–6.5** for most plants

You monitor this with a pH meter and adjust with pH Up or pH Down solutions.

## The 6 main hydroponic systems (compared)

Each system delivers water, nutrients, and oxygen differently. Here's what matters for home growers:

| System | Complexity | Electricity Needed | Best For | Cost (INR) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| **Kratky** | Very Easy | No | Leafy greens, herbs | ₹200–500/plant |
| **DWC** | Easy | Yes (air pump) | Leafy greens, tomatoes, peppers | ₹800–1,500/bucket |
| **NFT** | Moderate | Yes (water pump) | Leafy greens, herbs (commercial) | ₹5,000–12,000 |
| **Ebb & Flow** | Moderate | Yes (water pump + timer) | Versatile (greens to fruiting) | ₹4,000–10,000 |
| **Drip System** | Moderate | Yes (water pump + timer) | Large plants, commercial | ₹5,000–15,000 |
| **Aeroponics** | Advanced | Yes (high-pressure pump) | Fast growth, research | ₹10,000–30,000 |

---

### 1. Kratky Method (the "set it and forget it" system)

**How it works:** Fill a container with nutrient solution. Place plant in net pot with roots touching the water. As the plant drinks, water level drops, creating an air gap where roots access oxygen. No pumps, no electricity, no moving parts.

**Setup:**
1. Take an opaque container (mason jar, 5L bucket, or storage bin)
2. Cut a hole in the lid for a net pot
3. Fill with water + hydroponic nutrients (to the bottom of the net pot)
4. Place seedling in net pot with clay pebbles or cocopeat
5. Wait. That's it.

**Best crops:** Lettuce, spinach, pak choi, herbs (basil, mint, coriander)

**Pros:**
- Simplest possible hydroponic system
- Zero electricity cost
- Perfect for testing if hydroponics is for you
- Can be done with ₹200 worth of materials

**Cons:**
- Not great for large or long-season plants (tomatoes, peppers)
- Can't easily top up nutrients without disrupting the air gap
- Slower growth compared to DWC (no active aeration)
- Algae risk if container isn't opaque

**Mumbai balcony tip:** Start with 3–5 Kratky jars on a windowsill. Grow lettuce. Harvest in 25–35 days. Total investment: under ₹1,000.

---

### 2. Deep Water Culture (DWC)

**How it works:** Plant roots are fully submerged in nutrient solution. An air pump pushes air through an air stone at the bottom of the container, oxygenating the water continuously. Roots get unlimited nutrients AND oxygen simultaneously.

**Setup:**
1. Use an opaque 10–20L bucket with lid
2. Cut hole in lid for net pot
3. Fill with water + nutrients (roots submerged)
4. Place air stone at bottom, connected to air pump outside
5. Run air pump 24/7

**Best crops:** Lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, basil—almost anything

**Pros:**
- Faster growth than Kratky (constant oxygenation)
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Can grow large plants (tomatoes in 20L buckets)
- Forgiving for beginners (air pump keeps roots alive even if you overfill)

**Cons:**
- Needs electricity (air pump runs 24/7, costs ~₹50–100/month)
- Water temperature matters (above 28°C reduces dissolved oxygen)
- One bucket per plant (space-intensive for many plants)
- Pump failure = root death within 24–48 hours

**DWC is the system I recommend for most Indian home growers.** It's simple, versatile, and teaches you the fundamentals (pH, EC, water temperature) without overwhelming complexity.

---

### 3. Nutrient Film Technique (NFT)

**How it works:** A thin film of nutrient solution flows continuously through flat-bottomed channels (usually PVC pipes or gutters). Plant roots sit in the channel with the bottom touching the flowing nutrient film while the tops stay exposed to air.

**Setup:**
1. Set up channels at a slight angle (1–3% slope)
2. Place reservoir below the lowest point
3. Pump nutrient solution from reservoir to the high end of channels
4. Solution flows by gravity through channels, past plant roots
5. Returns to reservoir via drain at low end
6. Pump recirculates continuously

**Best crops:** Leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, kale), herbs, strawberries

**Pros:**
- Excellent water/nutrient efficiency (recirculating system)
- Space-saving (channels can be stacked vertically)
- Great for growing many small plants (20–100+ lettuce heads)
- Commercial-grade system that scales well

**Cons:**
- Pump failure = roots dry out within hours (thin film evaporates fast)
- Not ideal for large-rooted plants (tomatoes can clog channels)
- Requires precise slope and flow rate calibration
- More components = more potential failure points

**Best for:** Growers who want to scale beyond 20 plants and focus on leafy greens.

---

### 4. Ebb and Flow (Flood and Drain)

**How it works:** A grow tray is periodically flooded with nutrient solution from a reservoir below, then drained back. Plants sit in net pots filled with growing media (clay pebbles, perlite). Timer controls flood cycles (typically 15 minutes on, 45 minutes off).

**Setup:**
1. Place grow tray above reservoir
2. Connect pump with timer
3. Pump floods tray to 2–3 cm depth
4. Timer shuts off pump; solution drains back to reservoir via gravity
5. Roots in growing media retain moisture between floods

**Best crops:** Versatile—herbs, leafy greens, tomatoes, peppers, strawberries

**Pros:**
- Versatile (works for greens AND fruiting plants)
- Roots get periodic oxygenation between floods
- Growing media provides physical support for larger plants
- Timer-based automation reduces daily maintenance

**Cons:**
- More complex setup (pump + timer + tray + overflow fitting)
- Timer failure can over-flood or under-water plants
- Growing media needs periodic cleaning/replacement
- Higher initial cost than Kratky or DWC

---

### 5. Drip System

**How it works:** Nutrient solution is pumped from a reservoir through tubing to individual drippers positioned at the base of each plant. Solution drips slowly onto the growing media, trickles through roots, and drains back to reservoir (recirculating) or to waste (run-to-waste).

**Best crops:** Large plants (tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers), commercial operations

**Pros:**
- Precise nutrient delivery to each plant
- Works well for large, long-season plants
- Scalable (add more drippers for more plants)

**Cons:**
- Drippers can clog (especially with organic nutrients)
- More tubing and fittings to manage
- Requires monitoring of flow rate to each plant

---

### 6. Aeroponics

**How it works:** Plant roots hang in air inside a closed chamber. High-pressure nozzles spray nutrient mist directly onto roots at intervals. Roots get maximum oxygen (they're in air) and nutrients (from mist).

**We covered this in detail in our [Aeroponics guide](/resources/controlled-environment-farming/aeroponics).**

---

## Understanding nutrients (what plants actually eat)

In soil, decomposed organic matter and minerals provide nutrients. In hydroponics, you supply them directly.

### The Big 3 (Macronutrients)

| Nutrient | Symbol | What it does | Deficiency sign |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Nitrogen** | N | Leaf and stem growth | Yellowing lower leaves, stunted growth |
| **Phosphorus** | P | Root development, flowering, fruiting | Purple/dark leaves, poor flowering |
| **Potassium** | K | Overall plant health, disease resistance | Brown leaf edges, weak stems |

### Secondary Nutrients

| Nutrient | Symbol | What it does |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Calcium** | Ca | Cell wall strength, root development |
| **Magnesium** | Mg | Central atom of chlorophyll (green color) |
| **Sulfur** | S | Protein synthesis, enzyme function |

### Micronutrients (trace amounts)

Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), Boron (B), Copper (Cu), Molybdenum (Mo), Chlorine (Cl)

### What to buy (India-specific)

For beginners, use a **pre-mixed hydroponic nutrient solution** rather than mixing individual salts:

| Product Type | Examples Available in India | Cost (INR) | Best For |
|-------------|---------------------------|------------|---------|
| **2-part liquid nutrient** | General Hydroponics Flora Series, CityGreens | ₹500–1,200 for 500ml set | Most versatile, adjustable ratios |
| **1-part powder** | Masterblend 4-18-38 + Calcium Nitrate + Epsom Salt | ₹400–800 for 1kg (makes 500–1000L) | Budget-friendly, long-lasting |
| **Pre-mixed liquid** | Various brands on Amazon India | ₹300–600 for 1L | Easiest for beginners (just add to water) |

**Recommendation for beginners:** Start with a pre-mixed liquid nutrient. It's more expensive per liter but eliminates mixing errors. Once you're comfortable, switch to Masterblend powder (cheapest long-term option).

---

## Understanding pH (the gatekeeper of nutrient absorption)

pH determines whether nutrients dissolved in water are actually available for plant roots to absorb. Even if you have perfect nutrient levels, wrong pH means plants can't use them.

### The pH scale for hydroponics

| pH Range | Status | What happens |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Below 5.0** | Too acidic | Iron, manganese toxicity; calcium/magnesium lockout |
| **5.5–6.5** | **Optimal** | All nutrients available; this is your target |
| **Above 7.0** | Too alkaline | Iron, zinc, manganese become unavailable; plants yellow |
| **Above 8.0** | Danger zone | Severe nutrient lockout; plants stop growing |

### How to measure pH

- **pH test drops (cheapest):** ₹150–300, add drops to water sample, compare color to chart. Accuracy: ±0.5
- **Digital pH meter (recommended):** ₹500–1,500, dip probe in water, read digital display. Accuracy: ±0.1
- **pH test strips:** ₹100–200, dip in water, compare color. Accuracy: ±0.5–1.0 (least reliable)

**Recommendation:** Buy a digital pH meter (₹800–1,200 range). Calibrate monthly with buffer solutions. It pays for itself in healthier plants.

### How to adjust pH

- **pH too high (alkaline):** Add pH Down solution (phosphoric acid). A few drops at a time.
- **pH too low (acidic):** Add pH Up solution (potassium hydroxide). A few drops at a time.
- **Always adjust gradually.** Add 1–2ml, wait 15 minutes, test again. Overshooting is worse than slow correction.

**Mumbai water note:** Mumbai tap water typically runs pH 7.0–7.5 (slightly alkaline). You'll almost always need pH Down. Let water sit 24 hours to dechlorinate before adding nutrients, then adjust pH.

---

## Understanding EC (how strong is your nutrient solution?)

EC stands for **Electrical Conductivity**, measured in millisiemens per centimeter (mS/cm). It tells you how concentrated your nutrient solution is.

| EC Range (mS/cm) | Status | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|---------------|
| **0.0–0.5** | Plain water | No nutrients (or very few) |
| **0.8–1.2** | Light feed | Good for seedlings, leafy greens, herbs |
| **1.2–1.8** | Medium feed | Good for vegetative growth, most crops |
| **1.8–2.5** | Strong feed | Good for fruiting plants (tomatoes, peppers) |
| **Above 3.0** | Too concentrated | Risk of nutrient burn (brown leaf tips) |

### How to measure EC

- **EC/TDS meter:** ₹500–1,200, dip probe in solution, read display
- **TDS meters** read in PPM (parts per million) instead of mS/cm. Conversion: EC × 500 = PPM (approximately)

### Practical EC management

1. Mix nutrients to target EC for your crop stage
2. Test EC every 2–3 days
3. If EC rises (water evaporating, nutrients concentrating): Add plain water
4. If EC drops (plants consuming nutrients): Add more nutrient solution
5. Change reservoir completely every 7–14 days (prevents nutrient imbalance)

## Setting up your first hydroponic system (DWC, step by step)

I recommend DWC for your first "real" system after experimenting with Kratky. Here's a complete walkthrough:

### Materials needed

| Item | Specification | Cost (INR) |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Opaque bucket with lid | 15–20L, food-grade plastic | ₹200–400 |
| Net pot | 3-inch or 4-inch | ₹20–50 |
| Clay pebbles (LECA) | 1–2L bag | ₹200–400 |
| Air pump | 2–4L/min output | ₹300–600 |
| Air stone | 2–4 inch disc or cylinder | ₹50–100 |
| Air tubing | 1–2 meters | ₹30–50 |
| Hydroponic nutrients | Pre-mixed liquid or Masterblend | ₹400–800 |
| pH meter | Digital | ₹800–1,200 |
| pH Up + pH Down | 100ml each | ₹200–400 |
| EC/TDS meter | Digital | ₹500–800 |

**Total: ₹2,700–4,800** for a complete single-bucket DWC system.

### Build steps

#### Step 1: Prepare the bucket
- Cut a hole in the lid sized to hold your net pot snugly
- Ensure bucket is opaque (light causes algae growth in nutrient solution)
- Wash bucket thoroughly before first use

#### Step 2: Set up aeration
- Place air stone at bottom of bucket
- Connect air tubing from air stone, through a small hole in the lid, to air pump outside
- Air pump must be positioned above water level (prevents backflow if power fails)

#### Step 3: Fill with nutrient solution
- Fill bucket with water (leave 2–3 cm below the bottom of the net pot)
- Let water sit 24 hours to dechlorinate (or use dechlorinator)
- Add nutrients per label instructions (start at 50% strength for seedlings)
- Test and adjust pH to 5.8–6.2
- Test EC (should be 0.8–1.2 mS/cm for seedlings)

#### Step 4: Prepare the plant
- Start seedling in rockwool cube, cocopeat plug, or directly in clay pebbles
- Once seedling has 2–3 true leaves and visible roots, it's ready for DWC
- Place seedling in net pot surrounded by clay pebbles
- Roots should just touch or nearly touch the nutrient solution

#### Step 5: Turn on air pump
- Run air pump 24/7 (non-negotiable)
- You should see vigorous bubbling at the surface
- Bubbles oxygenate the water and create gentle root movement

#### Step 6: Monitor and maintain

**Daily:**
- Check air pump is running (listen for bubbling)
- Check water level (top up with plain pH-adjusted water if low)
- Observe plant for stress signs (wilting, yellowing, curling)

**Every 2–3 days:**
- Test pH (adjust to 5.8–6.2)
- Test EC (adjust if needed)

**Weekly:**
- Top up nutrients (add nutrient solution if EC has dropped)
- Check root health (should be white/cream colored; brown = problems)

**Every 10–14 days:**
- Full reservoir change (dump old solution, refill with fresh)
- Clean air stone if needed (soak in vinegar 30 min)

---

## What to grow first (and what to avoid)

### Start here (forgiving, fast-growing)

- **Lettuce** (all varieties) — 25–35 days, very forgiving of pH/EC mistakes
- **Spinach** — 30–40 days, prefers cooler temperatures
- **Pak choi / Bok choy** — 30–40 days, fast and reliable
- **Basil** — Continuous harvest after 30 days, loves warmth (perfect for Mumbai)
- **Mint** — Aggressive grower, nearly impossible to kill
- **Coriander / Cilantro** — 25–35 days, needs cooler temps (winter crop in Mumbai)

### Intermediate (after 2–3 successful harvests)

- **Tomatoes** (cherry varieties best for DWC) — 60–80 days, needs support/staking
- **Chillies / Peppers** — 70–90 days, loves warmth
- **Cucumbers** — 50–70 days, needs trellis, drinks a LOT of water
- **Strawberries** — Longer cycle, rewarding

### Avoid for now

- **Root vegetables** (carrots, radishes, potatoes) — Possible but awkward in most hydroponic systems
- **Corn** — Too tall, too space-hungry, inefficient use of hydro setup
- **Large melons/pumpkins** — Massive root systems, need huge reservoirs

## Nutrient solution recipes (practical mixing guide)

### Recipe 1: Pre-mixed liquid (easiest)

Follow label instructions. Typically 5–10ml per liter of water. Adjust pH after mixing.

### Recipe 2: Masterblend formula (cheapest long-term)

For 10 liters of nutrient solution:
1. Dissolve 24g Masterblend 4-18-38 in water
2. Dissolve 24g Calcium Nitrate (15.5-0-0) in same water
3. Dissolve 12g Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate) in same water
4. Stir well
5. Test and adjust pH to 5.8–6.2
6. Test EC (should be ~1.5–2.0 mS/cm)

**Important:** Add Masterblend and Epsom Salt first, then Calcium Nitrate last. If you add Calcium Nitrate directly with Masterblend before dissolving, calcium can precipitate out (white clumpy residue = wasted nutrients).

### Recipe 3: General Hydroponics Flora Series (versatile)

Three-part system (Grow, Micro, Bloom) mixed in different ratios for different growth stages:

| Stage | FloraGro | FloraMicro | FloraBloom | Per Liter |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Seedling** | 1ml | 1ml | 1ml | Light feed |
| **Vegetative** | 3ml | 2ml | 1ml | Medium feed |
| **Flowering/Fruiting** | 1ml | 2ml | 3ml | Bloom-heavy |

**Always add FloraMicro first** (prevents nutrient lockout), then Grow, then Bloom.

---

## Water temperature (the often-ignored factor)

| Water Temp (°C) | Effect on Plants |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Below 15°C** | Root shock, slow nutrient uptake, stunted growth |
| **18–22°C** | Ideal for most crops; maximum dissolved oxygen |
| **22–26°C** | Good, but dissolved oxygen starts decreasing |
| **Above 28°C** | Danger zone: low oxygen, root rot risk increases dramatically |
| **Above 30°C** | Critical: bacteria multiply, roots suffocate, plants die |

**Mumbai summer problem:** Ambient water temperature can reach 28–32°C (March–May). Solutions:
- Keep reservoir in shade (never direct sun)
- Use white/reflective buckets (reduce heat absorption)
- Add frozen water bottles to reservoir (temporary cooling)
- Increase aeration (more bubbles = more oxygen at higher temps)
- Grow during October–February when water stays 20–26°C naturally

---

## Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)

### Mistake 1: Not checking pH

**What happens:** Plants yellow, stop growing, develop deficiencies despite having nutrients in water
**Why it happens:** Beginners add nutrients and assume plants can use them
**Fix:** Test pH every 2–3 days. Adjust to 5.8–6.2. This single habit prevents 70% of hydroponic problems.

### Mistake 2: Overfeeding nutrients

**What happens:** Brown/burnt leaf tips, dark green leaves that curl
**Why it happens:** "More nutrients = faster growth" logic (wrong)
**Fix:** Start at 50% recommended strength. Increase gradually. Monitor EC. Less is safer than more.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring water temperature

**What happens:** Roots turn brown and slimy (root rot), plants wilt despite being in water
**Why it happens:** Warm water holds less dissolved oxygen; bacteria thrive in warm, low-oxygen water
**Fix:** Keep water below 26°C. Increase aeration. Change reservoir more frequently in summer.

### Mistake 4: Using transparent containers

**What happens:** Algae grows inside container (green slime), competes with plants for nutrients
**Why it happens:** Light reaches nutrient solution through clear/translucent containers
**Fix:** Use opaque containers only. If you only have clear ones, wrap in aluminum foil or black tape.

### Mistake 5: No backup for power failures

**What happens:** Air pump stops → dissolved oxygen drops → roots suffocate → plant death (DWC)
**Why it happens:** Mumbai power cuts (common during monsoon storms)
**Fix:** Keep air gap like Kratky as backup (don't fill water to brim). Consider UPS or battery backup for air pump (₹1,000–2,000).

### Mistake 6: Starting with fruiting plants

**What happens:** Frustration, nutrient problems, pH swings, disappointing yield
**Why it happens:** Tomatoes and peppers need precise nutrient ratios that change through growth stages
**Fix:** Start with lettuce. It's forgiving, fast, and teaches you the system. Graduate to tomatoes after 2–3 successful lettuce harvests.

### Mistake 7: Never changing the reservoir

**What happens:** Nutrient imbalances accumulate, pH becomes unstable, salt buildup
**Why it happens:** Laziness or "it still looks fine" thinking
**Fix:** Complete reservoir change every 10–14 days. Fresh solution = reset to known-good conditions.

## Hydroponics vs soil growing (when each makes sense)

| Factor | Hydroponics | Soil Growing |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Growth speed** | 30–50% faster | Standard |
| **Water usage** | 80–90% less (recirculating) | High (drainage, evaporation) |
| **Space needed** | Less (no root spread in soil) | More (root zone in soil) |
| **Pest/disease** | Fewer soil-borne issues | Soil pests, fungal diseases common |
| **Nutrient control** | Precise (you mix exactly) | Approximate (depends on soil quality) |
| **Learning curve** | Steeper (pH, EC, systems) | Gentler (nature does more work) |
| **Forgiveness** | Low (mistakes show fast) | Higher (soil buffers errors) |
| **Cost** | Higher initial investment | Lower startup cost |
| **Taste** | Excellent (some say cleaner) | Excellent (some say richer) |

**Choose hydroponics if:**
- You have limited space (balcony, windowsill)
- You want faster harvests
- You enjoy the technical/DIY aspect
- You want pesticide-free greens
- You're growing in Mumbai monsoon (soil stays waterlogged; hydro avoids this)

**Choose soil if:**
- You're growing for the first time ever (more forgiving)
- You have outdoor garden space
- You want lower startup costs
- You prefer a more "natural" feeling approach

## Mumbai / Indian home gardener adaptations

### Best growing season

**October–February** is ideal: ambient temperatures 20–28°C, humidity 40–65%, water stays cool. Start your first hydroponic system in October.

### Summer (March–May) challenges

- Water temperature rises above 28°C (root rot risk)
- Keep reservoirs shaded, increase aeration
- Consider pausing DWC and using Kratky (no electricity = no pump failure during power cuts)

### Monsoon (June–September) challenges

- High humidity (80–95%) increases mold risk on leaves near water surface
- Power cuts disrupt air pumps
- Keep backup Kratky jars as insurance
- Ensure good ventilation around plants

### Where to buy supplies in India

- **Amazon India:** pH/EC meters, air pumps, clay pebbles, net pots, nutrients
- **IndiaMART:** Bulk supplies, commercial NFT channels, pumps
- **CityGreens (citygreens.in):** India-specific hydroponic kits, nutrients, seeds
- **Local aquarium shops:** Air pumps, air stones, tubing (often cheaper than online)

### Indian crops that work great in hydroponics

- **Methi (fenugreek):** Fast-growing, loves water, great in Kratky
- **Palak (spinach):** Classic hydro crop, 30–40 day harvest
- **Pudina (mint):** Aggressive grower, continuous harvest
- **Tulsi (basil):** Loves warm water, perfect for Mumbai
- **Mirchi (green chillies):** DWC bucket, 70–90 day cycle, rewarding

## Final thought

Hydroponics isn't about replacing soil—it's about understanding what plants actually need and delivering it directly. Once you see roots thriving in clear water, absorbing nutrients you mixed, producing a lettuce head in 30 days on your Mumbai balcony… you'll understand why people get hooked.

Start with one Kratky jar. Spend ₹500. Grow one lettuce. Eat it.

Then decide if you want to go deeper. The rabbit hole is wonderfully deep.
